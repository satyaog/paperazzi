[ ${ }^{18}$ F]TRACK is the first PET radioligand for TrkB/C with proven in vivo brain penetration and ontarget specific signal. Here we report dosimetry data for [ ${ }^{18}$ F]TRACK in healthy humans. 6 healthy participants (age 22-61 y, 3 female) were scanned on a General Electric Discovery PET/CT 690 scanner. [ ${ }^{18}$ F]TRACK was synthesized with high molar activities ( $\\mathrm{A}_{\\mathrm{m}}=250 \\pm 75 \\mathrm{GBq} / \\mu \\mathrm{mol}$ ), and a dynamic series of 12 whole-body scans were acquired after injection of 129 to 147 MBq of the tracer. Images were reconstructed with standard corrections using the manufacturer's OSEM algorithm. Tracer concentration time-activity curves (TACs) were obtained using CT-derived volumes-of-interest. Organ-specific doses and the total effective dose were estimated using the Committee on Medical Internal Radiation Dose equation for adults and tabulated Source tissue values ( S values).\nResults: Average organ absorbed dose was highest for liver and gall bladder with $6.1 \\mathrm{E}-2( \\pm 1.06 \\mathrm{E}-2) \\mathrm{mGy} / \\mathrm{MBq}$ and $4.6( \\pm 1.18 \\mathrm{E}-2) \\mathrm{mGy} / \\mathrm{MBq}$, respectively. Total detriment weighted effective dose $\\mathrm{E}_{\\mathrm{DW}}$ was $1.63 \\mathrm{E}-2 \\pm 1.68 \\mathrm{E}-3 \\mathrm{mSv} / \\mathrm{MBq}$. Organ-specific TACs indicated predominantly hepatic tracer elimination.\nConclusion: Total and organ-specific effective doses for $\\left[{ }^{18} \\mathrm{~F}\\right]$ TRACK are low and the dosimetry profile is similar to other ${ }^{18} \\mathrm{~F}$-labelled radio tracers currently used in clinical settings.\nKeywords: Tropomyosin receptor kinases, Positron emission tomography, $\\left[{ }^{18} \\mathrm{~F}\\right] T R A C K$, Dosimetry\n\n## Introduction\n\nTrk receptors in the central nervous system (CNS) regulate many aspects of neuronal development and function, such as cell differentiation, dendritic outgrowth, and synaptic plasticity. They are classified according to the neurotrophins they interact with (Reichardt 2006): TrkA is activated through nerve growth factor (NGF), TrkB interacts with brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and neurotrophin-4 (NT4) while neurotrophin 3 (NT-3) binds to TrkC.\n\n\n[^0]:    *Conrespondence: alexander.thiel@mcgill.ca\n    ${ }^{1}$ Jewish General Hospital and Lady Davis Institute for Medical Research, 3755 Chernin de la Cote St. Cathérine, Montreal, Québec H3T 1E2, Canada\n    Full list of author information is available at the end of the article"

      "markdown": "Within the CNS, reduced expression or abnormal and impaired signalling of Trk receptors are found in a vast spectrum of disorders and pathologies, such as ischemic stroke, Alzheimer's disease (AD) and others (Tejeda and Díaz-Guerra 2017).\n\nWe developed $\\left[{ }^{18} \\mathrm{~F}\\right]$ TRACK, an ${ }^{18} \\mathrm{~F}$-derivative of $\\left[{ }^{11} \\mathrm{C}\\right]-(R)$-IPMICF16 (BernardGauthier et al. 2017), displaying significantly reduced P-gp-liability, brain offtarget selectivity, and favorably adjusted binding affinity in $\\operatorname{TrkB} / \\mathrm{C}$ rich regions (Bernard-Gauthier et al. 2018). [ $\\left.{ }^{18} \\mathrm{~F}\\right]$ TRACK showed excellent in vivo pharmacokinetic properties in all species including humans (Bailey et al. 2019), permeates the blood-brain-barrier rapidly with fast reversible binding kinetics and a high specific signal as demonstrated by competition studies (Bernard-Gauthier et al. 2017). Finally, in line with previous immunohistochemical detection and in situ hybridization studies of post-mortem tissue, this tracer adequately quantified the $\\operatorname{TrkB} / \\mathrm{C}$ density reduction in the hippocampus of AD patients as compared to healthy brains in initial in vitro studies (Bernard-Gauthier et al. 2017, 2018). The objective of this study was to provide dosimetry data for $\\left[{ }^{18} \\mathrm{~F}\\right]$ TRACK in humans.\n\n# Methods \n\nWe studied 6 healthy participants ( 3 male, 3 female) between 22 and 61 years of age with no history of metabolic, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular or psychiatric disorders. Subjects were recruited through advertisements following ethics board approval (CCER20-21-03). Demographic data, injected doses and injected masses are summarized in Table 1.\n$\\left[{ }^{18} \\mathrm{~F}\\right]$ TRACK was synthesized as previously described (Mossine et al. 2017). Radiochemical yield was $4.4 \\pm 0.8 \\%$ not corrected for decay (activity range $3.5-5.7 \\mathrm{GBq}$ ) with $>99 \\%$ radiochemical purity and molar activities of $250 \\pm 82 \\mathrm{GBq} / \\mu \\mathrm{mol}$ at the end of synthesis. No effect of radiotracer on vital signs was recorded during the scan.\n\nPET scans were performed on a General Electric Discovery PET-CT 690 scanner (GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, WI) at the PERFORM Centre, Concordia University, Montréal. First, whole body CT scans were obtained for attenuation correction and anatomical localization. Subsequently, an intravenous bolus of $\\left[{ }^{18} \\mathrm{~F}\\right]$ TRACK was injected over 1 min (dose range: 129 to 147 MBq ) followed by 12 whole body emission scans of 8 bed positions each.\n\nTable 1 Participant demographics, molar $\\left[{ }^{18} \\mathrm{~F}\\right]$ TRACK activity $\\left(\\mathrm{A}_{\\mathrm{m}}\\right)$ and injected activity and mass\n\n| Subject | Sex | Age | Body weight [kg] | $\\mathrm{A}_{\\mathrm{m}}[\\mathrm{GBq} / \\mu \\mathrm{mol}]$ | Injected activity [MBq] | Injected mass [ $\\mu \\mathrm{g}]$ |\n| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |\n| S1 | Male | 26 | 85 | 389 | 133.3 | 0.323 |\n| S2 | Female | 59 | 49 | 236 | 129.3 | 0.376 |\n| S3 | Female | 24 | 60 | 250 | 156.4 | 0.367 |\n| S4 | Female | 54 | 65 | 144 | 129.0 | 0.663 |\n| S5 | Male | 42 | 69 | 277 | 138.4 | 0.328 |\n| S6 | Male | 18 | 74 | 203 | 147.0 | 0.411 |\n| Mean $\\pm$ SD |  |  |  | $250 \\pm 82$ | $138.9 \\pm 10.90$ | $0.41 \\pm 0.13$ |"

The activity in $\\mathrm{Bq} / \\mathrm{mL}$ from each voxel of each frame was obtained, activity values were multiplied by voxel volume to obtain total activity in MBq per organ and time integrated activity (TIA) was calculated for each voxel. For each organ, the TIA 3D matrix was convoluted to the corresponding mask to only extract the cumulated activity for the respective organ, from which the average cumulated activity was computed and normalized to injected activity to obtain time integrated activity coefficients (TIAC).\n\nThe radiation doses absorbed by the target organs from surrounding source organs were calculated using the MIRD method (Cherry et al. 2012). The absorbed target organ dose per unit activity is the sum of the cumulated activity in each of the source organs multiplied by a dose factor (S-value) in units of Gy/Bq*s (MIRD-Calc software V1.1Genesis (Carter et al. 2021; Kesner et al. 2018)). The effective (E) and detriment weighted dose $\\left(\\mathrm{E}_{\\mathrm{DW}}\\right)$ for each subject were obtained by summation of the equivalent dose multiplied by the organ specific weighting factors.\n\n# Results \n\nThe distribution of radioactivity over time is illustrated for one subject (Fig. 1); peak activities for all source organs are listed in Table 2. Average time activity curves for all source organs are shown in the Fig. 2. All source organs show a first activity peak within minutes after tracer injection related to perfusion and rapid organ uptake (e.g., liver).\n\nTable 2 Source organs, peak activity and peak time\n\n| Source organ | First peak activity <br> $[\\mathrm{MBq}]$ | First peak time <br> $[\\mathrm{min}]$ | Second peak activity <br> $[\\mathrm{MBq}]$ | Second <br> peak time <br> $[\\mathrm{min}]$ |\n| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |\n| Urinary bladder | 0.07 | 2 | 0.138 | 95 |\n| Bone/ bone marrow | 13.0 | 4.5 | - | - |\n| Brain | 2.4 | 4.5 | - | - |\n| Gall bladder | 0.55 | 4.5 | 0.94 | 85 |\n| Heart | 8.84 | 2 | - | - |\n| Kidney | 5.67 | 2 | - | - |\n| Colon content | 0.55 | 2 | 0.60 | 397 |\n| Liver | 37.00 | 9 | - | - |\n| Lungs | 27.3 | 2 | - | - |\n| Ovaries | 0.02 | 2 | - | - |\n| Small bowel | 1.28 | 2 | 2.48 | 397 |\n| Testes | 0.07 | 2 | - | - |\n| Thyroid | 0.14 | 2 | - | - |\n| Rest of body | 70 | 2 | - | - |"

Organs of the digestive tract (gall bladder, small bowel, and colon) also showed a delayed second activity peak and larger inter-individual variability consistent with hepato-biliary elimination and variations in intestinal motility (Fig. 2).\n\nThe model explained on average 89.7 ( $\\pm 3.27$ ) \\% of the total injected activity (Table 3). Consistent with hepato-biliary elimination, the absorbed dose coefficients were highest for liver and gall bladder with $6.1 \\mathrm{E}-2( \\pm 1.06 \\mathrm{E}-2) \\mathrm{mGy} / \\mathrm{MBq}$ and $4.6( \\pm 1.18 \\mathrm{E}-2)$ $\\mathrm{mGy} / \\mathrm{MBq}$ respectively. Absorbed dose coefficients for reproductive organs were low with $1.12 \\mathrm{E}-2( \\pm 0.16 \\mathrm{E}-2) \\mathrm{mGy} / \\mathrm{MBq}$ for the ovaries and $0.9 \\mathrm{E}-2( \\pm 0.39 \\mathrm{E}-2) \\mathrm{mGy} /$ MBq for the testicles. Absorbed dose coefficients for all target organs are listed in Fig. 3.\n\nThe equivalent dose coefficients ranged from 1.49 to $1.70 \\mathrm{mSv} / \\mathrm{MBq}$ with an average of $1.62 \\mathrm{E}-2( \\pm 0.86 \\mathrm{E}-3) \\mathrm{mSv} / \\mathrm{MBq}$. Range for the detriment weighted dose $\\left(\\mathrm{E}_{\\mathrm{DW}}\\right)$ coefficient was similar from 1.45 to $1.92 \\mathrm{mSv} / \\mathrm{MBq}$ with an average $\\mathrm{E}_{\\mathrm{DW}}$ across subjects of $1.63 \\mathrm{E}-2( \\pm 1.68 \\mathrm{E}-3)$. This corresponded to an $\\mathrm{E}_{\\mathrm{DW}}$ of 2.12 to 2.32 mSv for the injected doses, or $5.51-6.48 \\mathrm{mSv}$ for a hypothetical dose of 370 MBq (Table 3).\n\n# Discussion \n\nThis is the first report on biodistribution and dosimetry of the new $\\operatorname{TrkB} / \\mathrm{C}$ receptor ligand $\\left[{ }^{18} \\mathrm{~F}\\right]$ TRACK in healthy humans.\n\nThe average equivalent dose coefficient estimate was $16.3 \\mu \\mathrm{~Sv} / \\mathrm{MBq}$ or 6.00 mSv for a standard injected dose of 370 MBq . Following injection, $\\left[{ }^{18} \\mathrm{~F}\\right]$ TRACK is rapidly distributed throughout the body with rapid uptake in liver, lungs, kidneys and brain. Consistent with the mainly hepatobiliary elimination, organ absorbed doses were high in the liver, gallbladder, and kidneys.\n\nThe equivalent dose coefficient estimates are well within the range of those for other ${ }^{18} \\mathrm{~F}$-labelled radiotracers (Jackson et al. 2020) such as $\\left[{ }^{18} \\mathrm{~F}\\right] \\mathrm{FDG}(19 \\mu \\mathrm{~Sv} / \\mathrm{MBq})$ or $\\left[{ }^{18} \\mathrm{~F}\\right]$ DOPA ( $26 \\mu \\mathrm{~Sv} / \\mathrm{MBq}$ ) (Kaushik et al. 2013), and those ${ }^{18} \\mathrm{~F}$-labelled tracers with primarily hepatobiliary elimination like Florbetapir ( $18.6 \\mu \\mathrm{~Sv} / \\mathrm{MBq}$ ) (Joshi et al. 2014). With appropriate adjustment of the injected dose, these dosimetry results will allow for repeated measurements in the same subjects without exceeding dose limitations in most jurisdictions (Jackson et al. 2020), which may be of interest when studying TrkB/C receptor density in neurodegeneration or during recovery from focal brain injury. The dosimetry model used in this study (Carter et al. 2021; Kesner et al. 2018) on average accounted for $89.7 \\%$ of injected activity with the residual activity accumulated below the knees outside the field of view and to some extent at the wall of the injection tubing due to lipophilicity of the tracer.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, $\\left[{ }^{18} \\mathrm{~F}\\right]$ TRACK, the first radiotracer for in vivo imaging of TrkB/C receptor density has a dosimetry profile that is similar to other ${ }^{18} \\mathrm{~F}$-labelled radiotracers currently used in clinical settings."
