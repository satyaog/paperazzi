However, no studies to date have assessed the impact of these morbidities on the patient/family. Our aim was to describe the clinical trajectory of patients with CDH and NDI (CDH-NDI), and to explore the lived experience and satisfaction of families with existing support resources.\nMethods: A multi-phase explanatory study (REB 2023-8964) was conducted.

Standard statistical analyses were performed for Phases 1 and 2, respectively.\nResults: Of 91 patients included, 27 had NDI, stratified into mild ( $\\mathrm{n}=2$ ), moderate ( $\\mathrm{n}=7$ ), and severe $(\\mathrm{n}=18)$ cohorts. Ventilation ( 16 vs. $8 ; \\mathrm{p}<0.001$ ), ICU ( 34 vs. $18 ; \\mathrm{p}<0.001$ ) and hospital ( 41 vs. 22 ; $\\mathrm{p}<0.001$ ) days were significantly longer in the severe cohort. The severe cohort required significantly more unscheduled visits, particularly in the first four years of life ( $\\mathrm{p}<0.05$ ). Despite high family satisfaction with existing resources, team communication during ICU-ward transfers could be improved. Parents also desired to share experiences with other CDH families.\nConclusion: CDH children with NDI require increased support, particularly in the first four years of life. While clinic satisfaction is high, improvement of team communication and access to support resources remain high priorities for parents.\nLevel of Evidence: Level II (prospectively collected data, retrospective analysis).\n(c) 2024 The Author(s).

With advances in neonatal intensive care leading to improved CDH survival, there has been a concomitant shift of clinical focus towards improving CDH survivor morbidity [1].\n\nStructured, long-term surveillance is critical for the early identification and mitigation of CDH morbidity. This is especially true for patients with neurodevelopmental impairment (NDI) [4,[7], [8], [9]. Indeed, up to two-thirds of CDH infants experience some form of neurodevelopmental or psychomotor delay by 3 years of age, which can significantly impact quality of life [2,[10], [11], [12]. NDI is most common in CDH infants requiring respiratory support or oxygen supplementation at day of life 28, in ECLS survivors, in those patients requiring patch repair (i.e. large defects), and in those born prematurely [1,13,14]. Despite recognizing the importance of long-term health surveillance, very few studies have evaluated the impact of survivor morbidity on both the patient and the family [15], [16], [17]. Furthermore, critical assessment of the efficacy of current long-term health surveillance programs in mitigating CDH morbidity and supporting families along their illness journey, or their satisfaction with the services they receive, is lacking.\n\nThe overall objective of this study was to describe the clinical trajectory of patients with CDH and NDI (CDH-NDI) and to explore the lived experience of families and their satisfaction with existing support resources. Understanding the clinical trajectory of patients allows us to identify inflections in care, periods of increased stress or concern with respect to the child's health and the impact on the family. Furthermore, knowledge of family satisfaction with supportive resources has important implications for quality improvement, resource allocation and healthcare delivery. We hypothesized that CDH children with severe NDI and their families would have higher unmet needs compared to CDH children without NDI, over the trajectory of their illness.\n\n## 2. Methods\n\nWe conducted a single-center cohort study of CDH patients with NDI followed in the long-term health surveillance clinic at the Montreal Children's Hospital (MCH). We previously identified 27 patients with NDI who formed the basis of this study [18].\n\n### 2.1. Determination of NDI\n\nThe entire CDH health surveillance cohort was first screened for NDI risk using classical clinical criteria, which included the need for extracorporeal life support (ECLS), oxygen supplementation at 28 days of life, and requirement for patch repair of their diaphragmatic defect (i.e. larger defect sizes) [1,13,14]. This was followed by the novel application of the CDH Study Group Mortality prediction score as an additional screen [19], which categorizes patients into low, moderate and high risk of mortality based on Apgar scores, birthweight, presence of pulmonary hypertension, and cardiac or chromosomal anomalies [20]. The following cut-offs were used for categorizing patients into low (0), moderate (1-2) or high (>3) risk of mortality, and were based off of the articles by Brindle et al. [19], and Cochius-den Otter et al [20]. NDI was subsequently confirmed in the entire cohort by formal developmental pediatrician assessments at 18 and 36 months, and correlated with the Bayley-3 assessment, when available [18]. The two-phase screening process demonstrated high fidelity in identifying the entire NDI cohort, with the developmental pediatrician assessment as the gold standard. Patients were classified as mild, moderate, and severe NDI based on developmental pediatrician assessment.\n\n### 2.2. Phase 1: Evaluation of clinical variables\n\nPhase 1 of the study involved retrospective review of prospectively collected clinical data and an assessment of outpatient clinic usage data for CDH patients with and without NDI. Patient recruitment occurred during neonatal admission or subsequent follow-up clinic appointments, when patients were consented and enrolled in our REDCap data registry. Data was collected prospectively from birth and retrospectively analyzed from March 2023 to February 2024. Patient demographics were obtained from the REDCap database, as well as from the electronic medical record (EMR). Clinic usage data was primarily obtained from detailed prospective patient summaries maintained by our clinic nurse specialist, comprised of hospital visits, telephone logs to the clinic nurse specialist, as well as correspondence and visit records with outside practitioners. The visits recorded in the patient summaries were cross-referenced with the EMR and the REDCap database. Clinic usage data for the non-NDI cohort was obtained as a comparison group. All visits beginning from initial hospital discharge until the end of data collection (February 2024) were included. Patients were excluded if they were less than 2 years of age at the time of study data analysis (February 2024), if they were diagnosed with CDH beyond 2 years of life, if they did not receive surgery for their CDH, if they were not actively followed in the clinic beyond 1 year of life, and/or if they had a significant chromosomal anomaly or a congenital heart defect requiring cardiac surgery. Visits to the clinic were categorized as \"scheduled\" if they followed the prescribed follow-up frequency at 4, 9, 18, and 36 months of age and every 2 years thereafter, which was based on the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) CDH post-discharge follow-up recommendations [21]. Visits were also considered as \"scheduled\" when patients were assessed by two or more CDH clinic members (e.g. surgery, respirology, neonatology, gastroenterology and cardiology) within 7 days, to account for older patients who were seen before the introduction of the multidisciplinary clinic in 2012. \"Unscheduled\" visits were visits that fell outside of the prescribed visit pattern and were further sub-classified by specialty.\n\n### 2.3. Phase 2: satisfaction with existing hospital resources\n\nPhase 2 involved a survey to assess family satisfaction with existing hospital resources (Appendix A). Data was collected from March 2023 to February 2024. The survey, comprised of a 5-point Likert scale and free text boxes, assessed satisfaction with known transition points in care, including the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), ward, discharge, and first clinic appointment. Following REB requirements, a member of the existing clinical team (clinic nurse) invited all eligible CDH-NDI families actively followed in the health surveillance clinic to participate. Interested families were then sent a digital copy of the survey by email. Participation in the survey was voluntary and participation implied consent. The survey was offered digitally in both English and French, with results tabulated together. Any French comments were translated to English by a bilingual member of the research team.\n\n### 2.4. Data extraction and analysis\n\nPatient demographic and clinical information was extracted from the CDH longterm follow-up clinic REDCap data registry and EMR. Patient clinic usage data was extracted from their clinical summaries, the REDCap data registry, and the EMR. Results are presented as means with standard deviation (SD) or median with interquartile range (IQR) for continuous variables and counts with proportions for categorical variables.

Statistical analyses were performed using Rstudio (Version 2023.12.1 + 402, International open-source collaborative). The English and French survey results were combined and subsequently tabulated for each Likert category. The 5-point Likert rating was converted to: 'Agree' = 4, 'Somewhat Agree' = 3, 'Somewhat Disagree' = 2, 'Disagree' = 1. 'Not Applicable/Unknown' was treated as missing data, with the subsequent number of responses for that particular question being reduced by 1 . Results are presented as means with standard deviation for each question, as well as counts of 'Agree' and proportions.\n\n### 2.5. Ethical considerations\n\nThe study received research ethics board approval (REB 2023-8964). Informed consent was obtained prior to prospective data collection in our REDCap Clinic Database (Phase 1 data), and was implied for survey participation in the study (Phase 2 data), as is typical for this form of data collection. Results were anonymized to ensure patient confidentiality.\n\n## 3. Results\n\n### 3.1. Phase 1: retrospective chart review\n\nOf 122 patients who are included in our long-term surveillance database, 27 patients were previously identified as having NDI, and were included in this study [18]. Of these, 2 patients were identified as having mild NDI, 7 moderate NDI, and 18 severe NDI based on 18- and 36-month screening by our CDH clinic developmental pediatrician. All 27 patients met inclusion criteria. Of the 95 nonNDI patients followed in our clinic, 31 were excluded due to age at time of study (8), death before age 2 (1), no follow-up in our clinic beyond age 1 (14), no surgery (1, possible diaphragmatic eventration), major chromosomal anomalies (2), and diagnosis past age 2 (5). The final sample included 64 CDH patients without NDI. Patient demographic variables and outcomes are presented in Table 1.\n\nThere was no difference in the rates of prenatal diagnosis, gestational age at birth, birthweight, delivery method, or CDH\nlaterality among groups. The severe NDI cohort was more likely to have a lower Apgar score at 5 min of life ( $\\mathrm{p}=0017$ ), a greater need for inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) ( $\\mathrm{p}<0.001$ ), a longer duration of ventilation ( $\\mathrm{p}<0.001$ ) and a greater length of both ICU ( $\\mathrm{p}<0.001$ ) and overall hospital stay ( $\\mathrm{p}<0.001$ ), when compared to the mild/ moderate NDI and non-NDI cohorts. When comparing the clinical support required at discharge, the groups had similar rates of oxygen supplementation and enteral access. Additionally, the severe NDI cohort was more likely to have gastroesophageal reflux (GERD) ( $\\mathrm{p}=0.002$ ), with a rate more than double that of the other groups.\n\nClinic usage data are presented in Fig. 1 as the median number of scheduled and unscheduled visits per patient between the 3 groups. While the greatest number of visits per patient (both scheduled and unscheduled) was observed in the first 4 years of life amongst all groups, the non-NDI cohort required fewer total visits compared to both the mild/moderate and severe NDI cohorts. Despite the differences in clinical demographic variables observed between the NDI cohorts, the median numbers of total visits were similar in the first two years of life. However, the severe NDI cohort required many more unscheduled visits when compared to the other groups. This difference was particularly notable in the first 2 years of life, but remained significant until 4 years of age (Table 2). A breakdown of the categories of the unscheduled visits in the first four years of life is presented in Fig. 2, with the severe NDI cohort requiring more emergency department, medical specialist (i.e. ENT, gastroenterology, respirology), and ancillary (i.e. audiology, nutrition, physical and occupational therapy) visits than the other cohorts.\n\n### 3.2. Phase 2: satisfaction survey\n\nAll 27 patients with NDI followed in our long-term follow-up clinic were approached to participate in the satisfaction survey. After a total of four communications (an initial correspondence, and three reminder e-mails), with links to both the English and French surveys online, the final sample included 12 families who participated in the survey. Survey results are presented in Table 3. Parents were extremely satisfied with the initial diagnosis and hospitalization in the NICU, with comments such as \"great follow-up, great\n\nTable 1\nParticipant demographics.\n\n|  | Severe <br> NDI (n = 18) | Mild \\& Moderate <br> NDI (n = 9) | CDH without <br> NDI (n = 64) | p-value |\n| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |\n| Demographic and Birth Details |  |  |  |  |\n| Male | 12 (67) | 4 (44) | 36 (56) | 0.528 |\n| Prenatal Diagnosis | 13 (72) | 4 (44) | 33 (52) | 0.213 |\n| Gestational Age at Birth (weeks) | 38.2 (2.0) | 39.0 (0.8) | 38.9 (1.97) | 0.266 |\n| Birth weight (kg) | 2.99 (0.6) | 3.12 (0.5) | 3.17 (0.5) | 0.613 |\n| Apgar at 5 min | $6(5-7)$ | $8(7-9)$ | $8(6-9)$ | 0.017 |\n| C-section | 2 (11) | 2 (22) | 18 (28) | 0.383 |\n| Hospital Course |  |  |  |  |\n| Length of ICU Stay (days) | 34 (22-55) | 7.5 (2-10) | 18 (10-40) | $<0.001$ |\n| Length of Hospital Stay (days) | 41 (35-72) | 10 (5-14) | 22 (14-46) | $<0.001$ |\n| Need for iNO | 13 (72) | 0 (0) | 24 (38) | $<0.001$ |\n| Duration of Ventilation (days) | 16 (9-25) | 3 (1-5) | $8(3-12)$ | $<0.001$ |\n| CDH Details |  |  |  |  |\n| Left-sided CDH | 13 (72) | 9 (100) | 51 (80) | 0.278 |\n| Requirement for Patch repair | 9 (50) | 0 (0) | 12 (19) | 0.005 |\n| Post-hospital Discharge |  |  |  |  |\n| Oxygen Support on Discharge | 3 (17) | 0 (0) | 5 (8) | 0.513 |\n| GERD on Discharge | 16 (89) | 4 (44) | 28 (44) | 0.002 |\n| Enteral Access on Discharge | 6 (33) | 1 (11) | 16 (25) | 0.499 |\n| Pneumonia in 1st Year of Life | 4 (22) | 1 (11) | 12 (19) | 0.832 |\n\nValues expressed in count (S), or median (interquartile range). p-values in bold met statistical significance.\n*Fisher's exact test was used to assess differences in categorical variables.

While satisfaction was overall quite high with the transition from NICU to the ward, parents expressed dissatisfaction with the information they were provided regarding the differences\nin the care routines between the ward and the NICU, as well as the communication between the medical teams surrounding NICU to ward transfer. Additionally, some parents expressed dissatisfaction with information they received regarding tests required for the follow-up of CDH, and the quality of communication between medical teams concerning the care plan for their child. Verbatim comments in this section shed light on possible failures in communication:\n\"The medical follow-up didn't give us the impression that the situation was fully understood and well managed. We always received the comment that the medical team was in an observation phase throughout our 3-week stay.\"\n\nSatisfaction with the period between hospital discharge and the first clinic visit was also high, with all families indicating knowledge of how to contact the CDH care team, and satisfaction with this communication process. Once again, while satisfaction was generally high with the first clinic visit, many parents expressed dissatisfaction with their ability to communicate with other parents of CDH children. Additionally, some parents expressed dissatisfaction with the wait time between clinicians and communication surrounding investigations being performed. General comments provided at the end of the survey suggested that despite areas for improvement, parents were overall satisfied with the care their child received, and the format of the long-term follow-up clinic:\n\"We were very satisfied with the care of our child.

A huge thank you to everyone!\"\n\n## 4. Discussion\n\nTo date, there is limited literature exploring the impact of associated co-morbidities on the quality of life of CDH patients and their families. The inclusion of family experiences offers new opportunities for quality improvement, particularly in vulnerable populations like CDH. Our findings provide evidence that CDH patients with severe NDI require increased support in the first years of life when compared to patients without NDI or those with mild/moderate NDI. Specifically, the severe NDI cohort required many more unscheduled visits, suggesting the need for increased surveillance efforts outside those recommended by the AAP [21] and advocated for in clinical practice guidelines [1,22]. Importantly, the unscheduled visits were often by health professionals outside of pediatric surgery and in particular, the emergency department. Patients most often required additional visits relating to feeding (i.e. failure to thrive, severe GERD) and respiratory (i.e. asthma and frequent respiratory infections) difficulties. These findings underscore the vital importance of a truly inter-disciplinary CDH health surveillance team that can provide access to other health professionals quickly on an \"as needed\" basis. Unfortunately, substantial variability continues to exist with regards to long-term health surveillance team composition, surveillance time points, surveillance duration and the diagnostic tests offered [4,7,23-25]. While our institution offers structured follow-up with a pediatric surgeon, respirologist, neonatologist, cardiologist, developmental pediatrician and gastroenterologist (when required), with follow-up points based on the AAP timeline, our results indicate that more intensive health surveillance and greater resources are required for the severe NDI cohort in the first years of life. Further analysis of the unmet needs in the severe NDI cohort is needed to ensure patients and families are supported appropriately. Our ability to anticipate these increased needs, and structure our surveillance programs around these \"inflection points\" in care, should lead to less resource utilization and unscheduled visits, especially in the severe NDI cohort [18,25,26]. This strategy may be particularly useful in resource-limited settings in which patients could be risk stratified to allow the limited, available support to be directed to patients in the highest-risk category [26]. Perhaps most importantly, our families, as well as other patient advocacy groups have identified the \"life journey\" as an important issue for clinicians to understand [27].\n\nThe results of our satisfaction survey suggest that parents are satisfied with the resources provided within our institution, particularly with the 'one-stop shop' offered by the long-term health surveillance clinic. Despite this, however, areas for improvement remain. In particular, survey results indicated dissatisfaction with communication amongst medical teams, particularly during transfer from NICU to ward. These results are not surprising, since patient transfer requires coordinated verbal transition of care amongst providers as well as the physical relocation of the patient, which if done sub-optimally, increases the risks of patient complication [28-30]. The risk of error is further exacerbated in pediatric surgical patients, due to the multidisciplinary coordination required, which can result in misunderstandings due to differing knowledge backgrounds, role ambiguity, differences in values, lack of teamwork and poor communication [29]. Furthermore, the added element of parental anxiety can further complicate the patient transfer event [28]. A\nrecent single-institution observational study of 31 post-surgical pediatric patient handovers demonstrated significant disagreements between teamwork ratings of transferring and receiving teams [31]. This study involved 109 ratings of involved providers, with the handoff team demonstrating situational awareness that was statistically greater than the receiving team [31]. While research on best handover practices is sparse, structured protocols, face-to-face transfer events with minimized disruptions, and common language to minimize errors and increase awareness and understanding among the receiving team have been suggested [29,30,32]. Quality improvement initiatives should consider a protocolized transfer process for CDH patients from NICU to ward, to ensure all teams have adequate situational awareness, and that communication and expectations amongst providers and with parents is improved. Design of these initiatives should consider barriers to implementation, such as time constraints limiting face-to-face transfer and knowledge gaps between transferring providers. Engaging key stakeholders in the design of these initiatives will ensure relevancy to those involved in the process, and will aid in overcoming implementation barriers.\n\nAnother common theme to emerge in the survey was a strong desire to interact with other families of children with CDH. The sentiments expressed by the parents in our study were echoed in a study of the needs of parents during prenatal counseling for CDH [33]. In this qualitative study of 19 families who had children with moderate or severe pulmonary hypoplasia, parents expressed feeling isolated, as they did not know anyone else in a similar situation [33]. Peer support organizations were considered helpful in providing parents information about living with a child with CDH, however this was not uniformly available to all parents. In our study, parents found the online support provided by advocacy groups to be lacking, and instead desired face-to-face tangible support from families in the same local context. This finding is in contrast with a recent qualitative study of parents' experiences with CDH child care, which identified online support forums, such as Facebook, to be helpful in managing insecurities and providing reassurance [34]. It is possible that local context may play a role in the desired type of support (online vs. face-to-face). This theme will be further explored in future focus groups with parents and their children to advise future quality improvement initiatives such as the development of a formal support group, or an informal support network.\n\nOur study has many strengths, including a patient-centered approach, longitudinal assessment of health visits stratified by NDI severity, and the assessment of satisfaction with hospital-provided resources. There are however some significant limitations as well. The visit data may not represent all unscheduled visits for a patient, particularly if visits were outside of our hospital network, and therefore not captured in our EMR. To overcome this challenge, we cross-referenced the EMR with patient clinical summaries maintained by our clinic nurse. Still, despite our best efforts, it is possible some visits may have been missed if no record was sent to our clinic nurse. It is therefore possible that our visit data may underestimate the true number of unscheduled visits for patients with CDH, which further demonstrates the importance of a multi-disciplinary CDH clinic to reduce these unscheduled visits, especially for those patients with severe NDI. A second limitation relates to the specific healthcare system of our study which may hinder generalizability of our results. Our long-term follow-up clinic operates in a singlepayer public healthcare system, where patients are not charged for their care, and their access to the clinic is not dependent on insurance status. Private payer systems may note differences in their clinic usage patterns. Despite this challenge, the same clinic usage patterns are likely to be observed in other healthcare systems, if not further exaggerated for patients without access to formal scheduled"

Lastly, we must acknowledge the possibility of recall bias present within our satisfaction survey strategy. Our survey asked parents to comment on known transition points in care early in the CDH care trajectory (NICU stay, transition to ward, hospital discharge and first clinic visit). While these are memorable moments not easily forgotten by families, it is possible that parents with older children may have had difficulty remembering these early moments. Given that few studies have evaluated patient and parent satisfaction with support resources, we believe this is a first step in understanding our patient and parent needs. Future studies may wish to collect surveys at different time points with questions tailored to each stage of the CDH care trajectory, to avoid the possibility of recall bias.\n\n## 5. Conclusion\n\nThis study is the first of its kind to assess the clinical trajectory and lived experiences of CDH-NDI children and families during long-term health surveillance. Children with CDH and severe NDI require increased support over the trajectory of their care, particularly in the first 4 years of life, suggesting that more formal visits may be required during this period. Future quality improvement efforts should aim to improve communication amongst medical teams, particularly during the transition from NICU to ward, and increase access to supportive resources, with the consideration of support groups, or other means of communication between families. Inclusion of patients and families in the development of these quality improvement measures will ensure that supportive resources offered are both desired, and effective. While much is known about the ongoing comorbidities associated with CDH, this study reveals there are significant gaps in knowledge with regards to the support needs of both patients and their families. Continued emphasis on the patient and family voice is needed to shed light on the impact of these findings, and to encourage effective resource allocation and patient-centered care for this vulnerable population.\n\n## Funding/support\n\nThis work was funded by the Mirella and Lino Saputo Foundation Chair in Pediatric Surgical Education and Patient and FamilyCentered Care, Department of Pediatric Surgery, McGill University Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, the John McCrae Fellowship, McGill University Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, the bourse Aude-Gabrielle et McKinley Bich pour l'excellence des soins en santÃ© mentale, McGill University Hospital Centre Research Institute, as well as the Montreal Children's Hospital Foundation.\n\n## Conflict of interest\n\nThe authors have no conflicts of interest relevant to this article to disclose.\n\n## Appendix A.
