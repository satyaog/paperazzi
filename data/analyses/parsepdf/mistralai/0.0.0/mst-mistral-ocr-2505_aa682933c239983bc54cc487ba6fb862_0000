To help ensure the safety of communities and support the mobilization of firefighting resources, rapid detection of areas affected by wildfires is required. Satellite data are ideally suited to provide near real-time wildfire information over large areas. At the same time, clouds, smoke, and haze can obscure the collection of observations from sensors typically used for mapping purposes. Established methods using coarse spatial resolution satellites (e.g., MODIS, VIIRS) rely upon the combination of daily revisit to enable the rapid and reliable detection of large active fires, in full or in part, and the application of modeling (including spatial buffering) to infer additional, yet still obscured, areas. While timely, these initial maps of wildfire-impacted areas do not capture small fires (those smaller than 200 ha ) and, importantly, are not intended to differentiate unburned areas within fire perimeters. To address these limitations, we used data from Sentinel-2A and -2B, and Landsat-8 and -9, which form a virtual constellation of four satellites to revisit and map burned area in Canada's forested ecosystems for the 2023 fire season. Availing upon the high temporal data density and using the Tracking Intra- and Inter-year Change algorithm (TIIC), an aggregate seasonal mapping of wildfires resulted in a total area affected by wildfires in 2023 of 12.74 Mha. Within this total area, 9.51 Mha of treed land cover was impacted. Shrubs and wetlands comprised most of the remaining non-treed area that was burned. Using a 2022 map of aboveground treed biomass (AGB), approximately 0.649 Pg of AGB was impacted by 2023 wildfires, representing an 11-fold increase in AGB impacts relative to a long-term annual average of treed AGB loss. Differences between the estimate of total burned area reported herein and the total burned area indicated by the Natural Resources Canada (NRCan) Fire M3 hotspot fire perimeters ( 18.64 Mha ) were analyzed. Overall, estimates of burned area differed by 5.9 Mha , including over 1.13 Mha of water identified as burned within the NRCan perimeters. Differences in land cover and AGB impacts between the two products were also investigated and quantified. TIIC enables the near-continuous capture of areas impacted by fire through the fire season, allowing for within-year refinement of total burned area, rapid interrogation of land cover types impacted, and estimation of associated biomass consequences.\n\n\n## 1. Introduction\n\nWildfires have always been present over Canada's forested landscapes (Hanes et al., 2019; Stocks et al., 2002), with the 2023 fire season reported as the most spatially extensive ever documented, surpassing the previous record for total area burned of 7.6 Mha in 1989 (Natural Resources Canada, 2023). The main factors thought to have contributed to the unprecedented 2023 fire season in Canada were the extreme fire-weather conditions, including unusually low precipitation and the warmest May-July period since 1940 (Barnes et al., 2023), resulting in an abnormally long fire season (Kolden et al., 2024). Canada is expected\nto continue to experience intense fire seasons, as recent decades have highlighted the consequences of climate change on the lengthening of fire seasons and the increasing frequency of fire-prone weather conditions (Ahatzoglou et al., 2019; Jain et al., 2017; Jones et al., 2022). Climate change is expected to have a significant impact on northern forests in particular due to rapid and considerable temperature increases in this region (Price et al., 2013), as each additional degree of warming could lead to a tripling of burned area (Ali et al., 2012). Therefore, accurate reporting of the impacts of the 2023 fires in Canada is important for understanding how unusual the 2023 fire season was compared to the long-term trends in fire activity, and for understanding the long-term\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    a Corresponding author.\n\n    E-mail address: flavie.pelletier@mail.mcgill.ca (F.

      "markdown": "impacts on forests and surrounding communities (Boulanger et al., 2024).\n\nRapid detection of wildfires is essential to support the allocation of firefighting resources and ensure the safety of communities (Johnston et al., 2020). Optical satellite imagery has been demonstrated as an appropriate data source for near real-time mapping of active fires (hotspots) over remote and large spatial extents (Wooster et al., 2021), such as Canada's forests (Fraser et al., 2000), when not obscured by clouds, smoke, or haze (Flannigan and Haar, 1986). Active fires, even at sub-pixel levels, can be detected using remote sensing instruments that are sensitive to middle infrared wavelengths ( $\\sim 4 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$ ). These detected hotspots can be merged using spatial proximity rules for aggregation (Fraser et al., 2000; Giglio et al., 2018) or be buffered to provide an estimate of burned areas that are obscured by smoke, haze, or cloud for generation of up-to-date estimates of burned area (Canadian Forest Service, 2022). Federally reported estimates of burned area in Canada are based upon the Fire Monitoring, Mapping and Modelling (Fire M3) daily hotspot mapping algorithm by Natural Resources Canada's (NRCan) Canadian Wildland Fire Information System (CWFIS; Englefield et al., 2004). Originally developed to utilize AVHRR imagery, later iterations of the algorithm have incorporated sensors with higher spatial resolution and improved radiometry and geometry, while maintaining a wide swath and frequent (daily) revisit, such as MODIS and VIRS. Due to the large pixels used, and ambiguity regarding the spatial location of actual hotspots, the resulting daily mapped fire perimeters are best suited for large fires (> 200 ha, https://cwfis.cfs.nrcan.gc.ca/background/dsm/fm3) and demonstrating trends rather than as a depiction of actual burned areas (White et al., 2017). As a heuristic, White et al. (2017) report an approximate expectation of a $40 \\%$ overestimation of burned area, based on a sample of large fires, from approaches using coarse spatial resolution satellite data (e.g., $1 \\mathrm{~km}^{2}$ ) compared to approaches using finer spatial resolution data (e.g., Landsat). Further, the larger the wildfire or the larger the number of fires, the greater the expectation for the overestimate in area. Fires coarsely mapped for short-term information needs can be further refined for long-term records and to meet the information needs associated with applications such as carbon accounting (Stinson et al., 2011). At the provincial level, the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre (CIFFC) collects daily fire progression information from provincial fire agencies. Fire perimeters from provincial agencies can be derived from ground/airborne GPS, manual sketch mapping, or remotely-sensed imagery (e.g., satellite, aerial, digital camera), leading to variable accuracy (Skakun et al., 2022). At the end of the fire season the fire perimeters reported by provincial agencies are compiled in the Canadian National Fire Database (CNFDB).\n\nWhile not as timely as daily hotspot detection (Wooster et al., 2021), mapping of burned areas can be improved by using data from satellites with medium spatial resolution ( $10-100 \\mathrm{~m}$ ). Satellites such as Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 and -9 are spectrally and spatially similar and form a virtual constellation when combined (Walder et al., 2015) enabling the acquisition of a unique image approximately every three days (Li and Roy, 2017). Multiple methods have been developed to map fires in Canada using time series of medium spatial resolution optical data (Hall et al., 2008; Hermosilla et al., 2015; Schroeder et al., 2011), often using the Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR; Key and Benson, 2006), or by combining satellite data with aerial survey information (Hall et al., 2020) to understand and calibrate historical burn records (Skakun et al., 2022). The latency associated with the complete generation of these burned area products may range from months to years, particularly for late-season fires, as imagery from the following year is often needed to accurately capture these events (Hall et al., 2020; White et al., 2014). Since 2004, Natural Resources Canada has produced the 30-m National Burned Area Composite (NBAC) in the year following each fire season, using mostly medium-resolution spatial imagery (Landsat, Sentinel-2), but also data directly from provincial agencies (Hall et al., 2020; Skakun et al., 2022). Considering all available products, the main challenge\nin accurate wildfire mapping remains the trade-off between spatial detail and timeliness. Wildfires can be rapidly detected using hotspot technology, but these methods do not accurately represent the actual burned area due to the nature of the data used and the processing applied (Fraser et al., 2000). Alternatively, medium-resolution optical imagery is often used to accurately map burned area, but only after the wildfire season has ended, resulting in a delay in the production of authoritative burned area maps (Skakun et al., 2022).\n\nTo limit the trade-off between spatial detail and timeliness, withinyear time series of medium spatial resolution imagery can be utilized. The imagery from the Sentinel-2 and Landsat virtual constellation is available via cloud access (notably, via Google Earth Engine) shortly after acquisition, providing multiple observations over short time intervals. This increases the probability of cloud- or smoke-free imagery and thus the ability to produce refined, near-real-time estimates of burned area, as changes for a given spatial extent can be mapped as a new image becomes available. The Tracking Intra- and Inter-year Change (TIIC) algorithm was developed to monitor forest change across Canada's forested ecosystems in near-real time by leveraging Sentinel-2A and -2B plus Landsat-8 and -9 (Pelletier et al., 2024). TIIC uses information from previous iterations of observations to self-optimize, resulting in an increasingly accurate mapping of burned areas at a spatial resolution that provides a detailed depiction of the location and extent of both large and small fires. This allows for rapid refinement of total burned area estimates and the generation of additional information on affected land cover types, including treed versus non-treed, and estimation of biomass loss.\n\nIn this study, we investigated the extent and impacts of the 2023 fire season using the near-real time TIIC algorithm (Pelletier et al., 2024). We mapped and calculated the total area burned in Canada's forested ecosystems in 2023, as well as the timing of these wildfires, the amount of aboveground biomass (AGB) affected, and the type of land cover impacted. We also compared compatible attributes between the TIIC burned areas with the fire perimeters and area estimates shared via NRCan's CWFIS and used supplemental information (i.e., land cover and AGB) to better understand the nature of the differences between the two map products. The novelty of the research presented herein in in demonstrating an approach that enables accurate mapping of burned area in a manner that is both spatially detailed and timely.\n\n## 2. Study area\n\nThe analysis is conducted for the entirety of Canada's forested ecosystems, which cover 650 Mha, and largely consist of treed areas (362 Mha, Natural Resources Canada, 2022), but also include extensive representation of wetlands, lakes, shrubs, and herbs. Canada's forested ecosystems are divided into 12 forest-dominated ecozones, following delineation reported in Stinson et al. (2011). Historically, wildfires in Canada have been concentrated in certain forest-dominated ecozones, such as the Boreal Shield West, Taiga Shield West, and Taiga Plains, where large areas typically burn annually (White et al., 2017, Fig. 1A). In contrast, the annual extent of fires is more limited in the Atlantic Maritime and Pacific Maritime ecozones. Before 2010, the Montane Cordillera was also burned at low rates, but over the past decade, this ecozone has been increasingly affected by severe fire seasons (e.g., the 2017 fire season; Crowley et al., 2019), with a significant increasing trend in area burned (Coops et al., 2018). Depending on the period of interest and data used, national estimates of average annual forest area burned range from 1.6 Mha (White et al., 2017) to 2.2 Mha (Skakun et al., 2022) to 2.5 Mha (Canadian Forest Service, 2022). In terms of land cover, on average $71 \\%$ of the area burned annually is covered by trees (Hermosilla et al., 2018) and 0.056 Pg out of a total of 27.32 Pg of AGB are estimated to burn annually (Walder et al., 2020)."

Methods\n\n### 3.1. Data\n\n### 3.1.1. Landsat and Sentinel-2 data\n\nTo map burned areas for the 2023 fire season, Google Earth Engine (Gorelick et al., 2017) datasets containing atmospherically corrected surface reflectance from Landsat 8 Collection 2 (LAND-SAT/LC08/C02/T1_L2), Landsat 9 Collection 2 (LAND-SAT/LC09/C02/T1_L2), and Sentinel-2A and -2B\n(COPERNICUS/S2_SR_HARMONIZED) were accessed. Images acquired between May 30 and October 25, for the years 2021 and 2022 were used to provide baseline surface reflectance information, and images acquired between May 30 and October 25, 2023, were used to detect burned pixels when compared to the baseline. We retained images with less than $70 \\%$ cloud cover per scene, using the quality assurance band to remove pixels designated as opaque or cirrus clouds for Landsat images, and the s2cloudless algorithm for Sentinel-2 images (Braaten et al., 2020)."

      "markdown": "### 3.1.2. NRCan fire data\n\nThe Fire Monitoring, Mapping, and Modeling System (Fire M3) from the CWFIS (Canadian Forest Service, 2022) identifies and maps actively burning fires (or hotspots) daily throughout the forest fire season using the latest MODIS and VIRS-I imagery, focusing on wildfires $>200$ ha (Fraser et al., 2000). These data are used as the basis for national reporting of active fires, and historical data are compiled in the Canadian National Fire Database (CNFDB; https://cwfis.cfs.nrcan.gc.ca/ha/ nfdb). During the 23 -week fire season, between April 26th and October 6th' 2023, 18.4 Mha over 6623 fires of all sizes were reported by provincial agencies (CIFFC), via the National Wildland Fire Situation Report (https://cwfis.cfs.nrcan.gc.ca/report). Fires $>200$ ha accounted for 822 of the 6623 fires, as compiled in the NRCan hotspot estimated perimeter database downloaded on October 11, and totalled 18.0 Mha of burned area. The 822 fire polygons (Fig. 1B) used for comparison in the analysis, were imported to Google Earth Engine, converted to a $30-\\mathrm{m}$ raster format and reprojected to a standard NAD83/Canada Lambert (EPSG: 3978) projection used for all the raster data included in this analysis. Non-spatial weekly estimates of area burned were obtained from the National Wildland Fire Situation report (https://cwfis.cfs. nrcan.gc.ca/report/graphs\\#gr4) to graph the timing of the cumulative burned area.\n\n### 3.1.3. Land cover data\n\nThe 2022 30-m land cover map for Canada's forested ecosystems was produced using the Virtual Land Cover Engine (VLCE) framework, which produces annual land cover maps based on the classification of Landsat spectral information, and environmental and topographic predictors, with temporal consistency informed by disturbances (Hermosilla et al., 2018, 2022). The VLCE comprises 12 land cover classes, including four that represent treed vegetation (coniferous, deciduous, mixedwood and wetland-treed). Assessment conducted with independent validation data resulted in an overall accuracy of $77.9 \\%$ (Hermosilla et al., 2022).\n\n### 3.1.4. Aboveground treed biomass data\n\nA 2022 30-m aboveground treed biomass map was produced following the methodology developed by Matasci et al. (2018b, 2018a), which integrated Landsat composite imagery with a comprehensive set of lidar plots using Nearest Neighborhood imputation to produce annual forest structure maps of Canada's forest ecosystems. The reported accuracy of the AGB maps, assessed using independent validation data, resulted in an $\\mathrm{R}^{2}$ of 0.699 , an RMSE $\\%$ of 65.8 , and a bias of -0.66 (Matasci et al., 2018a). To determine the impacts of the 2023 wildfires, we followed Pelletier et al. (2024) to use pixel-level estimates of AGB increment based on long-term data to project to a 2023 AGB expectation.\n\n### 3.2. Tracking Intra- and inter-year change\n\nFires in Canada's forested ecozones were monitored in near-real time using the Tracking Intra- and Inter-year Change (TIIC) algorithm (Pelletier et al., 2024) developed in Google Earth Engine (Gorelick et al., 2017). This algorithm enables the identification of stand-replacing disturbances based on a time series of images. To do this, TIIC builds an expectation time series from the spectral signature of a pixel from one or more years of images prior to the year of analysis, which is compared to new images that are acquired in near-real time (referred to as the target time series). The 2023 fire season was analyzed by building the expectation time series using spectral information from the 2021 and 2022 growing seasons from Sentinel-2A and -2B, Landsat-8, and Landsat-9 imagery. As new images are acquired and added to the target time series, TIIC calculates the probability of change for each pixel and identifies as candidate-changed pixels those that are typed as fire and have a probability of change greater than 0.5 . Changes were confirmed when the probability of change exceeded 0.3 , and the date associated with a\nburned pixel was then recorded. This recorded date of a burned pixel could be delayed from days to weeks depending on the availability of imagery and the presence of clouds, haze, or smoke. The recorded dates of burned pixels were resampled into 10-day time windows. Water bodies were excluded from the final burned pixels based on the water category in the land cover classification. Accuracy assessment using independent validation data showed a gradual increase in accuracy for the stand-replacing change class as additional images were added to the algorithm (from an initial producer's accuracy of $23 \\%$ at the beginning of the growing season to $98 \\%$ at the end of nine 10-day time windows), with a user's accuracy of $97 \\%$ (Pelletier et al., 2024). Moreover, the pixels assessed as having been burned had a user's accuracy and a producer's accuracy of $99 \\%$.\n\nChange pixels were grouped into two classes based on the detection period: summer fires and fall fires. Summer burned pixels were detected between May 30th and September 17th, and the fall burned pixels were detected between September 17th and October 25th. As a result, there are eleven summer 10-day time windows ( 110 days) and almost four time windows in the fall ( 38 days). For the summer fires, burned pixels were identified as changed and typed as fire by TIIC, independently of the NRCan perimeters. The fall period was added as an extension of the summer analysis period introduced in Pelletier et al. (2024), to allow for examination of the entire 2023 NRCan fire perimeter record. For the fall period, TIIC only detected changes within a $4-\\mathrm{km}$ buffer of the NRCan fire perimeters. This approach was used to limit commission errors that can arise due to known limitations of mapping with optical data during fall due to phenology, snow cover, or low sun angles (Huang et al., 2010).\n\n### 3.3. Comparison of TIIC and NRCan burned area estimates\n\nWe compared the results of the TIIC detection of burned area from the 2023 fire season with the results of the NRCan fire perimeters. Analyses were conducted for Canada's forested ecosystems and stratified by forest ecozone. We calculated the total area burned and the area burned by land cover class to better understand the impact of wildfires on land cover. We also calculated the AGB impacted by the wildfires for each product. Burned pixels were assumed to result in almost complete or eventual depletion of AGB, so the AGB values associated with burned pixels were summed to obtain the total AGB loss. Finally, we analyzed the temporal correspondence of the area burned detected by comparing the timing of the TIIC burned pixels to the reported non-spatial weekly estimates described above.\n\n## 4. Results\n\n### 4.1. Area burned\n\nFor the 2023 fire season, the TIIC algorithm detected 12.74 Mha of burned area in Canada's forested ecozones (Table 1, Fig. 2), representing $1.8 \\%$ of the total forest-dominated ecozone area. Of the 12.74 Mha , 11.57 Mha ( $90.9 \\%$ ) was burned by summer fires, and 1.16 Mha ( $9.1 \\%$ ) by fall fires (Table 2). The ecozones with the largest area burned were the Taiga Plains ( 3.51 Mha ), followed by the Taiga Shield East ( 2.33 Mha ), Boreal Plains ( 1.93 Mha ), Taiga Shield West ( 1.23 Mha ) and Boreal Shield East ( 1.22 Mha ). The Atlantic ( 0.02 Mha ) and Pacific Maritime ( 0.07 Mha ) ecozones were the least affected by wildfires. In comparison, the NRCan fire perimeters mapped a total of 18.64 Mha of burned area. The largest burned area was reported in the Taiga Plains ( 5.23 Mha ), Boreal Plains ( 3.29 Mha ) and Taiga Shield East ( 2.62 Mha ). The area burned by the NRCan fire perimeter ranged from 1.12 times (Taiga Shield East) to 1.71 times (Boreal Plains) greater than that detected by TIIC (Fig. 3), except in the Pacific Maritime. The largest differences in burned area between TIIC and NRCan were found in those ecozones that experienced more fires (i.e., Boreal Plains, Taiga Shield West, Montane Cordillera). This trend was not found in the Pacific"

The total and relative area of wetland ( 1.96 Mha, 10\\%) and wetland-treed ( $1.57 \\mathrm{Mha}, 8 \\%$ ) vegetation impacted by the NRCan perimeters was greater than that indicated by TIIC burned areas ( 1.04 Mha, $8 \\%$ and 0.99 Mha $8 \\%$, respectively). This difference was most pronounced in the Boreal Plains, Hudson Plains, and Taiga Plains ecozones.\n\n### 4.3. Aboveground treed biomass consequences of 2023 wildfires\n\nCanada's forest-dominated ecozones contained approximately 28 Pg of AGB in 2022 (Table 3). In absence of disturbance, the total AGB accrued in 2023 would be 0.90 Pg , as derived from the long-term pixelspecific average AGB increment, following the method presented in Pelletier et al. (2024). Based on the NRCan fire perimeters over the entirety of Canada's forested ecosystems, an estimated 0.94 Pg of AGB was lost during the 2023 fire season ( $3.33 \\%$ of total AGB), while with the TIIC algorithm, the estimated AGB loss was 0.65 Pg ( $2.30 \\%$ of total AGB). The largest AGB losses from the TIIC results were reported for the Taiga Plains (203.52 Tg or $9.55 \\%$ of the ecozone total) and Boreal Plains ( 162.43 Tg or $4.05 \\%$ ). Although the amount of AGB burned was smaller in the Taiga Shield East ( 54.27 Tg ) and Taiga Shield West ( 41.42 Tg ), relative to the ecozone, the Taiga Shield East lost $4.59 \\%$ of the AGB and Taiga Shield West lost $6.30 \\%$. In contrast, AGB losses were minimal in the Atlantic Maritime ( 1.06 Tg ), Pacific Maritime ( 1.85 Tg ) and Taiga Cordillera ( 2.56 Tg ).\n\n### 4.4. Timing of burned pixels\n\nThe area burned across the season for TIIC shows that the burned area steadily increased throughout the summer, up until mid-September (Fig. 6), which usually coincides with the end of the fire season in Canada (Coogan et al., 2020). The weekly reporting for NRCan started when the first hotspots were detected (April 26 in 2023), with more spatially extensive burning starting two weeks later. The total burned area reported by NRCan rose steadily throughout the fire season, as well as the burned area detected by TIIC. The larger the burned area increments reported by NRCan, the larger the divergence between TIIC\n\nTable 3\nEcozone-level summaries and totals for Canada's forested ecosystems of aboveground biomass (AGB) loss during the 2023 fire season.\n\n| Ecozone | Total AGB <br> 2022 (Tg) | NRCan |  | TIIC |  |\n| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |\n|  |  | AGB <br> loss <br> (Tg) | AGB loss <br> (\\% of <br> ecozone) | AGB <br> loss <br> (Tg) | AGB loss <br> (\\% of <br> ecozone) |\n| Atlantic <br> Maritime | 1501.01 | 1.35 | 0.09 | 1.06 | 0.07 |\n| Boreal <br> Cordillera | 1741.26 | 17.50 | 1.01 | 14.53 | 0.83 |\n| Boreal Plains | 4014.21 | 260.01 | 6.48 | 162.43 | 4.05 |\n| Boreal Shield <br> East | 5883.92 | 80.99 | 1.38 | 60.88 | 1.03 |\n| Boreal Shield <br> West | 3454.98 | 62.36 | 1.8 | 45.50 | 1.32 |\n| Hudson <br> Plains | 626.72 | 10.84 | 1.73 | 9.16 | 1.46 |\n| Montane <br> Cordillera | 4329.45 | 95.15 | 2.20 | 51.91 | 1.20 |\n| Pacific <br> Maritime | 2408.66 | 4.39 | 0.18 | 1.85 | 0.08 |\n| Taiga <br> Cordillera | 254.09 | 2.92 | 1.155 | 2.56 | 1.01 |\n| Taiga Plains | 2131.44 | 299.08 | 14.03 | 203.52 | 9.55 |\n| Taiga Shield <br> East | 1183.31 | 52.99 | 4.48 | 54.27 | 4.59 |\n| Taiga Shield <br> West | 663.59 | 54.20 | 8.17 | 41.42 | 6.30 |\n| Canada's <br> forested <br> ecosystems | 28,192.66 | 941.78 | 3.34 | 649.48 | 2.30 |\n\nand NRCan values.\nThe ecozone-level analysis showed different timing dynamics (Fig. 7). The Atlantic Maritime had few fires that occurred before the analysis period (pre May 30). In the Taiga Cordillera, most of the burning occurred in August with few fires happening at the beginning and end of the analysis period. In the Taiga Plains, the area burned was constant throughout June to October. The Boreal Plains, Boreal Shield East, and Boreal Shield West ecozones experienced fires before and at the beginning of the analysis period, which then slowly decreased by the end of August."

Cumulative area burned per 2023 date for all of Canada's forested ecozones based on the Tracking Intra- and Inter-year Change (TIIC) algorithm and the weekly burned area reported by Natural Resources Canada (NRCan).\n\n## 5. Discussion\n\nHerein, we used the TIIC change detection algorithm to map the areas impacted in the 2023 wildfire season at a 30-m spatial resolution and quantified the land cover impacts and the AGB consequences of these fires. Landsat and Sentinel-2 satellites provide medium spatial resolution imagery, based upon individual satellite revisit frequency, enabling TIIC to map wildfires throughout the fire season and at a management-relevant scale, limiting the trade-offs between scale and timeliness. Our results showed that more land burned in Canada during the 2023 wildfire season than in any other year since record-keeping began (Coops et al., 2018; Hanes et al., 2019; Stocks et al., 2002; White et al., 2022), exemplifying forecasted wildfire-related trends, including a lengthening of the fire season, a greater number of large\nfires, and an increase in the burned area (Hanes et al., 2019).\nTo undertake meaningful comparisons, it is prudent to match total burned areas derived from similar data sources. The TIIC burned areas are perhaps most analogous with the NBAC, because they utilize similar data sources, mostly Landsat and Sentinel-2. However, the 2023 areas cannot be compared as the 2023 NBAC was not yet available at time of writing. This does however highlight the latency that the TIIC algorithm addresses by providing near real-time medium spatial resolution wildfire information. NBAC is intended to provide a consistent, and refined estimate of burned area nationally, and the production of such a curated product requires time and effort to generate (Hall et al., 2020). There is a gap therefore wherein a product such as that derived from the TIIC algorithm can provide more rapidly refined estimates of area burned and associated consequences. Accounting for images acquired up to October 25, TIIC identified 12.74 Mha of land that was burned during the 2023 wildfire season, compared to the previous high of 6.65 Mha (Skakun et al., 2022) that was reported as burned in 1989 in the NBAC, which represents almost a 2-fold increase. More generally, the 12.74 Mha of burned area is 7.96 times greater than the Landsat-based long-term annual average burned area of 1.6 Mha (Coops et al., 2018; White et al., 2017). Differences in area burned are expected when comparing TIIC burned area to NRCan fire perimeters, as both the intended use and the data sources used to generate the products are different. There are trade-offs associated with both products. NRCan fire perimeters are a daily examination of active fires at a coarse spatial resolution, while TIIC maps burned areas within days to weeks at a fine spatial resolution. Despite their different characteristics and resolution, both products successfully detect burned areas at the same locations, as demonstrated by their agreement of 11.02 Mha of burned area. This comparison highlights the value of TIIC as an additional intra-year detection tool as it operates on a similar time frame (within a growing season) as the NRCan fire perimeters, but with finer spatial resolution.\n\nDuring extreme fire seasons like the one Canada experienced in 2023, fire management agencies focus on rapid-response and safety\n![img-6.jpeg](img-6.jpeg)\n\nFig. 7.

This need for timely information can necessitate the use of data and models that meet the short-term need such as the NRCan fire perimeters that are usually available within 24 h of a hotspot detection. However, these methods tend to lead to an overestimation of the burned areas, such as through inclusion of unburned islands or water bodies (Skakun et al., 2021; Walker et al., 2018; White et al., 2017). The overestimation of area can have consequences for applications such as carbon accounting, leading to identification of the need for more spatially refined estimates of burned area (Stinson et al., 2011). The NBAC product was developed to improve the determination of burned area (Hall et al., 2020) and to inform Canada's carbon budget modeling activities (de Groot et al., 2007), retrospectively providing refined estimates and products for operational programs. Past research has shown that the difference between the burned areas mapped using more refined approaches and those reported in the CNFDB increases as the total burned area increases (White et al., 2017). Our results indicate that the total burned area initially reported for Canada in 2023 ( 18.4 Mha ) is much larger than the actual area burned. The total burned area we mapped was 12.74 Mha , including 11.02 Mha that was also captured by the NRCan perimeters, which is $59 \\%$ of the burned area included in the NRCan fire perimeters ( 18.64 Mha ). This result is comparable to that reported by White et al. (2017), who found a $61 \\%$ overlap between their burned area and the burned area reported by the CNFDB for high burn years when considering a sample of large fires that accounted for at least $50 \\%$ of the area disturbed by wildfire in a given year. Our results for a census of all fires in a single fire year support and extend the findings of White et al. (2017), by showing that the overestimation does not only apply to large fires, but across fires of all sizes on average. Acknowledging that the burned area maps produced by TIIC are not perfect, the accuracy assessment of the methods applied herein to the same area for 2019 demonstrated that the mapped burned areas were reliably identified by the end of the fire season ( $98 \\%$ producer's accuracy, $97 \\%$ user's accuracy; Pelletier et al., 2024). Considering that the current estimate reported by NRCan includes more than 1 Mha of water bodies (Fig. 5), and that the burned area is expected to be overestimated on an annual basis ( $\\sim 43.8 \\%$; White et al., 2017), and given the comparison to previous mapping exercises with more spatially detailed sources of satellite data (Hermosilla et al., 2018; Skakun et al., 2021; White et al., 2017), we suggest that the actual burned area is likely closer to the 12.74 Mha reported herein than the 18.64 Mha estimated by the NRCan perimeters.\n\nUnderstanding the impacts of fires upon land cover is important as vegetation recovery will vary depending on the severity of a fire as well as what burned (White et al., 2022). Generally, large fires tend to occur in more northern and less productive forests, which lengthens the recovery, but the land cover class associated with the burned area also influences that rate of recovery (Madoui et al., 2015; White et al., 2022). Non-treed vegetation, which represented $25 \\%$ of the overall burned area based on the TIIC algorithm, generally recovers more quickly than treed vegetation (White et al., 2022). Within the treed vegetation, coniferous forests, which were the most affected by wildfires due to their flammability (Parisien et al., 2023), take longer to recover than broadleaf or mixedwood that can re-establish quickly post-fire (Bartels et al., 2016; White et al., 2022). Similarly, it has been shown that post-fire recovery varies per ecozone (White et al., 2022). The Taiga Shield East ( 2.33 Mha burned) and the Taiga Shield West ( 1.23 Mha burned) are the slowest to recover following wildfires (White et al., 2017, 2022White et al., 2022). Based upon the spatial resolution of the imagery utilized, the TIIC algorithm can map fires smaller than 200 ha, which represent a large proportion of the overall fires every year (Hanes et al., 2019). Even if the total annual area burned by small fires is minor when compared with that of large fires, there is value in capturing those smaller burned areas since they comprised a majority (by number) of wildfires in Canada and are therefore key to understanding fire regime variability (Hanes et al., 2019) and overall impacts of wildfire on forest ecosystems.\n\nAGB is a critical reservoir of forest carbon, and reporting AGB in addition to the area burned provides further context regarding the\nimpact of a fire as the relationship between the two is non-linear (Wulder et al., 2020). Our results show that an estimated 649 Tg of treed AGB, representing $2.3 \\%$ of the total treed AGB of Canada's forested ecozones, was impacted during the 2023 fire season. This was $36 \\%$ less treed AGB than was impacted using the NRCan perimeters, which were associated with a loss of 942 Tg . To contextualize the AGB loss associated with TIIC, Wulder et al. (2020) reported an annual rate of AGB loss due to wildfire of 56 Tg for the period between 1985 and 2016 and an overall loss for the same period of 1790 Tg . Therefore, the AGB loss from the 2023 fire season was an 11-fold increase over that longer-term annual average. Biomass change can be considered as constrained to the presence of disturbance or as part of an ecosystem-wide process of punctual and large losses over small areas concurrent with gradual and small increases of larger areas. While the areas differ, when assessing more broadly over the entire forested ecosystem, growth and biomass uptake for undisturbed areas historically has been about the same as the losses constrained to disturbed areas (Wulder et al., 2020), including for 2023 and the large burned area.\n\n## 6. Conclusion\n\nWe demonstrated the capacity to map burned areas at a 30-m spatial resolution in near-real time from multiple sensors for the 2023 fire season. The TIIC mapping approach provides a means to avail upon cloud data processing to enable the generation of low latency mapping of burned area. These multisource estimates can also be used to provide insights on the land cover types impacted by wildfires, as well as the treed AGB consequences. Moreover, the spatial detail captured by TIIC offers a reasonably rapid means to refine annual burned area estimates for assessing impacts. Initial estimates of burned area have been demonstrated to overestimate burned areas in large fire years, typically by $\\sim 40 \\%$ on an annual basis, with a latency before refined estimates can be generated from higher spatial resolution remotely sensed data. For 2023, this meant a difference of about 5.9 Mha , partially based upon mapping 1.12 Mha of water as burned area. Moving forward, parallel and complementary sets of remote sensing activities can be implemented to inform important short-term emergency planning information needs via established hotspot approaches with concurrent analysis of a dense time series of within-year imagery to provide spatially detailed and revised map products and related area estimates.\n\n## CRediT authorship contribution statement\n\nFlavie Pelletier: Writing - original draft, Visualization, Software, Methodology, Formal analysis, Conceptualization.
