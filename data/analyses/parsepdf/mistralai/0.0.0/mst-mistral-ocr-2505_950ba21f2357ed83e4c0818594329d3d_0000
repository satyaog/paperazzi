With this workshop we aimed to highlight the potential of using graph-based models for biomedical image analysis. Our goal was to bring together scientists that use and develop graph-based models for the analysis of biomedical images and encourage the exploration of graph-based models for difficult clinical problems within a variety of biomedical imaging contexts.\n\nGraph-based models have been developed for a wide variety of problems in computer vision and biomedical image analysis. Applications ranging from segmentation, registration, classification, and shape modeling, to population analysis have been successfully encoded through graph structures, demonstrating the versatile and principled nature of graph-based approaches. Graphs are powerful mathematical structures which provide a flexible and scalable framework to model objects and their interactions in a readily interpretable fashion. As a consequence, an important body of work has been developed around different methodological aspects of graphs including, but not limited to, graphical models, graph-theoretical algorithms, spectral graph analysis, graph dimensionality reduction, and graph-based network analysis. However, new topics are also emerging as the outcome of interdisciplinary studies, shedding light on areas like deep-structured models and signal processing on graphs.\n\nThe GRAIL proceedings contain 7 high-quality papers of 8 to 11 pages that were pre-selected through a rigorous peer review process. All submissions were peer-reviewed through a double-blind process by at least 3 members of the Program Committee, comprising 18 experts in the field of graphs in biomedical image analysis. The accepted manuscripts cover a wide set of graph-based medical image analysis methods and applications, including probabilistic graphical models, neuroimaging using graph representations, machine learning for diagnosis and disease prediction, and shape modeling.\n\nThe proceedings of the workshop are published as a joint LNCS volume alongside other satellite events organized in conjunction with MICCAI. In addition to the LNCS volume, to promote transparency, the papers' reviews are publicly available on the workshop website (https://biomedic.doc.ic.ac.uk/miccai17-grail/) alongside their corresponding optional response to reviewers.\n\nWe wish to thank all the GRAIL 2017 authors for their participation and the members of the Program Committee for their detailed feedback and commitment to the workshop. We are very grateful to our sponsors CentraleSupelec and Inria for their valuable support.\n\nSeptember 2017\nEnzo Ferrante\nSarah Parisot\nAristeidis Sotiras"

The first workshop in the MFCA series was held in 2006 in Copenhagen, Denmark. This was followed by workshops in New York, USA, in 2008; Toronto, Canada, in 2011; Nagoya, Japan, in 2013; and Munich, Germany, in $2015^{1}$.\n\nThe goal of computational anatomy is to analyze and to statistically model the anatomy of organs in different subjects. Computational anatomic methods are generally based on the extraction of anatomical features or manifolds which are then statistically analyzed, often through a non-linear registration. There are nowadays a growing number of methods that can faithfully deal with the underlying biomechanical behavior of intra-subject deformations. However, it is more difficult to relate the anatomies of different subjects. In the absence of any justified physical model, diffeomorphisms provide the most general mathematical framework for enforcing topological consistency. However, working with this infinite dimensional space raises some deep computational and mathematical problems, in particular for doing statistics. Likewise, modeling the variability of surfaces leads to relying on shape spaces that are much more complex than for curves. To cope with these, different methodological and computational frameworks have been proposed (e.g., using smooth left-invariant metrics, focusing on well-behaved subspaces of diffeomorphisms, or modeling surfaces using currents, etc.). The goal of the MFCA workshop is to foster interaction between researchers investigating the combination of geometry and statistics in non-linear image and surface registration in the context of computational anatomy from different points of view. A special emphasis is put on theoretical developments, with applications and results being welcomed as illustrations.\n\nThe 10 papers presented in this volume were carefully selected from a number of very high quality submissions following a thorough peer review process. All of the papers were presented as oral presentations, with ample time for in-depth discussions. We would like to thank the authors of the papers and the members of the Program Committee for their efforts in making a strong program for MFCA 2017.\n\nSeptember 2017\nXavier Pennec\nSarang Joshi\nMads Nielsen\nTom Fletcher\nStanley Durrleman\nStefan Sommer\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{1}$ http://www.inria.fr/sophia/asclepios/events/MFCA06/. http://www.inria.fr/sophia/asclepios/events/MFCA08/. http://www.inria.fr/sophia/asclepios/events/MFCA11/. http://www.inria.fr/sophia/asclepios/events/MFCA13/. http://www.inria.fr/sophia/asclepios/events/MFCA15/."

The first workshop was held at MICCAI 2014, at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA. MICGen brings together researchers and clinicians from various fields including medical genetics, computational biology, and medical imaging, presenting a forum for both fundamental concepts as well as state-of-the-art methods and applications. MICGen traditionally includes tutorial talks discussing fundamental concepts and challenges of imaging genetics, as well as oral presentations of accepted papers presenting novel methods or new applications. All researchers interested in imaging genetics, regardless of experience, are invited to attend.\n\nImaging genetics studies the relationships between genetic variation and measurements from anatomical or functional imaging data, often in the context of a disorder. While traditional genetic analyses are successful for deciphering simple genetic traits, imaging genetics can aid in understanding the underlying complex genetic mechanisms of multifaceted phenotypes. Specifically, imaging-based biomarkers are used as an intermediate or alternative phenotype that provides a rich quantitative characterization of disease. As large imaging genetics datasets are becoming available, their analysis poses unprecedented methodological challenges. MICCAI offers an ideal and timely opportunity to bring together people with different expertise and shared interests in this rapidly evolving field.\n\n## Adrian V. Dalca\n\nNematollah K.
