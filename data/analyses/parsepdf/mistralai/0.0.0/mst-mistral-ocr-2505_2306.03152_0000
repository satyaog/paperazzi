The high equivalent width of the PAH feature indicates that star formation, rather than black hole accretion, dominates the infrared emission throughout the galaxy. The light from PAH molecules, large dust grains, and stars and hot dust are spatially distinct from one another, leading to order-of-magnitude variations in the PAH equivalent width and the ratio of PAH to total infrared luminosity across the galaxy. The spatial variations we observe suggest either a physical offset between the PAHs and large dust grains or wide variations in the local ultraviolet radiation field. Our observations demonstrate that differences in the emission from PAH molecules and large dust grains are a complex result of localized processes within early galaxies.\n\nWe observed the galaxy SPT0418-47 (SPT-S J041839-4751.9) as part of the Targeting Extremely Magnified Panchromatic Lensed Arcs and Their Extended Star formation (TEMPLATES) Early Release Science program on JWST. This galaxy was selected from the 2,500deg ${ }^{2}$ South Pole Telescope catalog ${ }^{8,9}$ of sources with dust-like spectra at millimeter wavelengths. Subsequent observations with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) confirmed SPT0418-47 as a z $=4.2248$ galaxy magnified by a factor of $\\sim 30-35$ by strong gravitational lensing into a hallmark Einstein ring morphology by a foreground galaxy at $\\mathrm{z}=0.263 .{ }^{10-12}$ Observations of the $158 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$ fine-structure line of ionized carbon suggested that this galaxy is isolated, with kinematics strongly dominated by rotational motions, ${ }^{13}$ though a re-analysis of existing data and new JWST imaging ${ }^{14}$ have identified a merging companion galaxy with a mass ratio of $\\approx 1: 5$. JWST and additional submillimeter wavelength observations both suggest that the gas in SPT0418-47 has already been enriched in heavy elements to nearly the solar abundance. ${ }^{15}$ After correction for the lensing magnification, the star formation rate of SPT0418-47 derived from its infrared (IR) luminosity is $350 \\pm 60 \\mathrm{M}_{\\odot} / \\mathrm{yr}$ (here and elsewhere the error range quoted corresponds to a $1 \\sigma$ uncertainty), sufficiently high to drive a galaxy-scale outflow of cold molecular gas from the galaxy. ${ }^{16}$\n\nWe used JWST's Mid-InfraRed Instrument (MIRI) in its Medium Resolution Spectroscopy (MRS) mode to observe the redshifted $3.3 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$ PAH feature. The $3.3 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$ line, the shortest-wavelength PAH feature, arises due to carbon-hydrogen vibrational modes in the PAH molecules and is preferentially emitted only by the smallest neutral PAH molecules (less than $\\approx 100$ carbon atoms). ${ }^{17,18}$ The MIRI/MRS operates as an integral field spectrograph, allowing the PAH emission to be spatially resolved. We processed the JWST data with the JWST pipeline"

Continuum emission arising from some combination of starlight and/or hot dust illuminated by an active galactic nucleus (AGN) is detected across the bandpass. We identify PAH emission at rest-frame $3.3 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$, detected at integrated signal-to-noise $\\approx 20$. A possible second feature is detected at rest-frame $3.4 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$, but the lack of spectral coverage redward of this feature makes its detection more tentative because the underlying continuum is poorly constrained. If real, this feature likely arises from PAHs with an aliphatic (i.e. lacking aromatic hydrocarbon rings) subgroup, although its origin is debated. ${ }^{19-21}$ We see no evidence of absorption due to the $3.1 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$ water ice feature detected in $30 \\%$ of low-redshift IR-luminous galaxies, ${ }^{22}$ though the limited bandpass again precludes strong conclusions on this point. We compare to recent JWST/NIRSpec observations of the star-forming nucleus in the $\\mathrm{z}=0.02$ galaxy merger VV114, which also shows strong $3.3 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$ PAH and $3.4 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$ aliphatic emission in addition to strong water absorption. ${ }^{23}$\n\nAs the first space-based mid-infrared integral field unit, the MIRI/MRS allows the PAH and underlying continuum emission to be spatially resolved at diffraction-limited 0.65 \" angular resolution. We collapsed the MRS data cube over the line-free spectral channels to create a map of the continuum emission, and used this image to subtract the continuum emission from the channels containing PAH emission (Methods). Figure 2 shows the continuum-subtracted $3.3 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$ PAH emission and the underlying rest-frame $3.1 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$ continuum emission. We also compare to archival ALMA imaging of the rest-frame $160 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$ dust continuum emission at matched spatial resolution (Methods). The spatial distribution of all three components is clearly distinct, an indication that the intrinsic lensing-corrected distribution of PAH, mid- and far-IR continuum emission are all different from one another. For the mid-IR and far-IR continuum, qualitatively similar morphologies are seen in MIRI F1800W imaging and ancillary ALMA data at similar spatial resolution, respectively, ${ }^{12,14}$ lending further credence to the morphology we observe. While we do not model the lensing deflections or reconstruct the intrinsic source emission in this work, the typical physical scale probed in these comparisons is expected to be $\\sim 800 \\mathrm{pc}$ due to the $\\sim 30 \\mathrm{x}$ lensing magnification.\n\nExtensive previous studies of low-redshift IR-luminous galaxies have demonstrated that the $3.3 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$ PAH equivalent width is a sensitive diagnostic of the presence of an obscured AGN. Hot dust surrounding the AGN dominates the mid-IR continuum, lowering the PAH equivalent width below a threshold value empirically found in the range $40-60 \\mathrm{~nm}$ by previous works. ${ }^{22,24,25}$ Figure 3a shows a map of the $3.3 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$ PAH equivalent width created from the MRS data. We find equivalent width variations of a factor of 10 across the individual pixels of SPT0418-47, a reflection of the spatial offset between the PAH and continuum emission. Gravitational lensing effects cannot be responsible for these variations, because lensing has no wavelength dependence and we have ensured all comparisons are made at matched spatial resolution.

Even on resolved scales, Fig. 3b shows that very few pixels fall below the 40-60nm threshold values suggested as AGN diagnostics. It is plausible that this is a resolution effect: if the region influenced by the putative AGN is much smaller than the 0.65 \" MRS spatial resolution at this wavelength, the expected low PAH equivalent width could be diluted by the surrounding high equivalent width star-forming regions. Even in this scenario, however, it is clear that the emission from a hypothetical AGN has not yet come to dominate the galaxy; the JWST data clearly rule out a dominant obscured AGN in this source. This result is in contrast with the only other $\\mathrm{z} \\sim 4$ galaxy detected in PAH emission, ${ }^{7}$ where the low $6.2 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$ PAH equivalent width suggests the presence of a dust-obscured AGN.\n\nThe complex spatial distribution of PAHs in SPT0418-47 is also evident in comparison to the larger millimeter-size dust grains responsible for the far-IR continuum emission. Fig. 3c illustrates these variations in comparison to the ALMA rest-160 $\\mu \\mathrm{m}$ continuum, which we take as a simple proxy for the total IR luminosity arising from large dust grains (an assumption we test in the Methods). The PAH emission in SPT0418-47 is weaker than all previous detections in galaxies at $\\mathrm{z}>1$, but this is certainly a selection effect due to the low sensitivity of the Spitzer Space Telescope at mid-IR wavelengths. As with the equivalent width, we again observe factor-of-five variations in the $\\mathrm{L}_{\\text {PAH }} / \\mathrm{L}_{\\text {IR }}$ ratio, driven by the spatial mismatch between the PAH and far-IR emission. On resolved scales, the individual pixels in the distribution of $\\mathrm{L}_{\\text {PAH }} / \\mathrm{L}_{\\text {IR }}$ trace out a similar range as that seen in the galaxy-averaged low-redshift sample, with the PAH emission becoming progressively weaker towards high $\\Sigma_{\\text {IR }}$. This suggests that the deficit of PAH emission arises on local scales within individual galaxies, and is not merely reflective of scatter in the overall galaxy population.\n\nThe origin of the spatial variations in $3.3 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$ PAH emission and the larger dust grains responsible for the far-IR emission is unclear. We have made no correction for possible extinction at $3.3 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$, which may be relevant if the PAH molecules are well-mixed with the larger dust grains in locations with equivalent visible wavelength attenuation $\\mathrm{A}_{\\mathrm{V}} \\sim 30 \\mathrm{mag} .{ }^{25,28,29}$ Arising from the smallest PAH molecules, the $3.3 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$ feature is especially sensitive to the local UV radiation field, dust destruction processes such as shocks or photodissociation, and grain growth processes that enhance PAH features at longer wavelengths to the detriment of the $3.3 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$ feature. ${ }^{17}$ The spatial variations may thus reflect a highly non-uniform UV radiation field or genuine differences in the distribution of the PAH molecules and millimeter-size dust grains. Whatever the cause, it is clear that the $3.3 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$ PAH feature is a poor tracer of the total IR luminosity on sub-galactic scales,"

Our results demonstrate spatial differences in the $3.3 \\mu \\mathrm{~m} \\mathrm{PAH}, 3.1 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$ continuum, and $160 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$ continuum emission, suggesting either that the small and large dust grains are not co-located within the galaxy or the presence of large variations in the heating of the dust grains by the local UV radiation field. Whether such spatial offsets are a common feature of high-redshift galaxies must be further investigated by future JWST observing campaigns now made possible by the high sensitivity and angular resolution of the MIRI/MRS instrument.\n\n# References \n\n1.

Vieira) was primarily designed to study star formation indicators in distant galaxies while exercising the spectroscopic capabilities of JWST using both the NIRSpec ${ }^{31,32}$ and MIRI/MRS ${ }^{33-35}$ integral field observing modes. In this work we focus on MRS observations of SPT0418-47 targeting the $3.3 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$ PAH feature redshifted to $17.2 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$, covered by Channel 3 of the LONG ('C') grating. The field-of-view is $5.2^{\\prime \\prime} \\times 6.2$ \" and the spectral resolving power is $\\approx 2600$ at the wavelength of the redshifted PAH feature. We used the SLOWR1 detector readout pattern, a standard 4-point dither pattern, and achieved an on-source integration time of 3440s. The science observations were accompanied by dedicated background exposures using the same parameters.\n\nThe data were taken on 8 August 2022, and we re-reduced the raw frames using version 1.8.4 of the JWST pipeline and pipeline calibration context jwst_1019.pmap. This version of the pipeline contains a preliminary treatment of the so-called 'shower' artifacts, the origin of which is still under investigation but likely related to cosmic rays. The uncalibrated science and background frames were processed with the Detector1 pipeline to apply detector-level corrections, fit the ramps, and identify and exclude cosmic ray and shower artifacts. The output rate images were processed outside the pipeline to flag additional bad pixels newly-identified using the dedicated background exposures. The Spec2 pipeline applies distortion and wavelength calibration, flux calibration, and other corrections to the science frames.\n\nWe use 2-D pixel-by-pixel background subtraction in this stage, where the individual background exposures were median combined to create a composite background image subtracted from the science data. While this is noisier in principle than the use of a 1-D master background spectrum, it negates detector and flat-field systematics that would otherwise limit our ability to detect faint extended structures in the science data at long wavelengths. Finally the Spec3 pipeline creates a 3-D data cube for each of the four channels observed in the LONG grating. The Channel 3 cube has 0.20 \" pixel scale in the spatial dimensions and 3 nm channels in the wavelength dimension.\n\nWe extracted a spectrum of SPT0418-47 from the background-subtracted data cube using an annular aperture with inner and outer radii 0.6 \" and 1.8 \" centered on the source. We created a simple constant continuum image of the source by collapsing all channels of the cube, excluding the PAH feature. We neglect any possible contribution from the hydrogen Pf- $\\delta 3.29 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$ line. This"

While the continuum in this region of the spectrum is known to be complex, ${ }^{29}$ the limited bandwidth of the cube precludes a more detailed treatment. We created a continuum-subtracted cube by subtracting this continuum image from each channel, and then created an image of only the PAH emission by summing over channels corresponding to rest-frame wavelengths $3.25-3.33 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$. This range is justified by the expected intrinsic width of the $3.3 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$ PAH solid-state feature. ${ }^{17,29}$\n\nMRS residual artifact removal. Although the JWST pipeline version we used has an early treatment to identify and flag cosmic ray shower artifacts, these artifacts are by far the dominant remaining instrumental artifact after pipeline processing and limit the sensitivity of our observations. Unflagged shower pixels are visible in the fully-calibrated 2-D frames and mapped into the 3-D cube. The regions on the detector affected by showers are typically several hundred pixels in area, with no obvious spatial structure. Due to the geometry of the slicing optics, these regions are generally contained within a single slice, but span tens of pixels in the along-slice and dispersion directions. When mapped from the 2-D frames into the 3-D data cube, the shower artifacts then manifest as stripes mostly aligned with the cube's x-dimension when the cube is built with the pipeline's IFUALIGN cube-building option. The artifacts are coherent over tens of channels in the wavelength dimension. Given the faintness of the PAH emission, these artifacts make subsequent analysis challenging. Moreover, because SPT0418-47 is an extended source and the PAH feature is intrinsically broad, true emission from the source would also exhibit similarly extended features in the 2-D frames, making a 2-D treatment of the background especially fraught. Instead we developed a background subtraction technique that largely removes these stripe artifacts in the 3-D cube, where the location of true source emission is well known. Presumably the removal of these shower artifacts will be an active area of research over the lifetime of JWST.\n\nWe used the photutils package to create an estimate of the residual stripe artifacts in each channel of the MRS data cube. We masked the location of the SPT0418-47 Einstein ring and foreground lens galaxy in every channel based on its known position and size from ALMA submillimeter observations to prevent true source emission from contaminating the background estimate. Because the stripes are coherent over tens of wavelength channels, we fit for the background using a 25 channel running average around each channel of the cube. The stripes are generally (though not perfectly, due to the curved slices of the IFU on the detector) aligned with the cube's x-dimension, so we force the background to consist of a series of rows in the x-direction, allowing a linear slope in the background from the left to the right half of the row. Each row was a single pixel in height, but we also tested variants using two- or three-pixel stripes. The two-pixel stripe template worked equally well as our one-pixel default, but the three-pixel variant still left notable striping artifacts, likely because the three-pixel version"

Recall that the background is estimated for each channel of the data cube using a 25 channel running average over the wavelength dimension. The stripes are (partly by construction) also visible in the estimated background over even larger wavelength intervals. The early JWST pipeline shower removal techniques alone leave significant artifacts that become visible due to the large spatial extent of the showers in the detector's y-dimension (cube wavelength dimension). The stripes that were removed well enough to be invisible in individual channels are now apparent when averaged over wavelength. The final result of this procedure yields a data cube with no stripe artifacts even when averaged in the wavelength dimension.\n\nWe have publicly released our full analysis scripts, including our custom artifact removal technique, on the TEMPLATES collaboration github repository https://github.com/jwst-templates.\n\nALMA observations and analysis. SPT0418-47 has been observed extensively by ALMA at many wavelengths. In this work we use the rest-frame $160 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$ observations obtained in projects 2016.1.01374.S (PI: Y. Hezaveh) and 2016.1.01499.S (PI: K. Litke); these data also covered the [CII] $158 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$ emission line. The data were reduced using standard pipeline scripts, and we performed a single round of phase-only self-calibration for each execution of the observing blocks. We jointly imaged the data using natural weighting of the visibilities, accounting for the primary beam response differences due to the different phase centers between the two ALMA projects.\n\nBecause we are primarily interested in the comparison between the PAH emission and the midand far-IR continuum, we used a combination of a $u v$-plane taper and the restoringbeam parameter of the CASA tclean task to produce a synthesized beam with 0.65 \" full-width-at-half-maximum and 0.2 \" pixel scale, matched to the diffraction-limited resolution of MIRI/MRS at the $17.2 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$ observed wavelength of the PAH feature. The synthesized beam is Gaussian by construction, while the MRS point spread function shows the characteristic star pattern of all JWST instruments. The S/N of the PAH detection is sufficiently low that the PSF wings have little influence on our comparison. The final ALMA $160 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$ image reaches a sensitivity of $120 \\mu \\mathrm{Jy} /$ beam and detects the source at a peak significance of $\\approx 110$. This is far higher than the $\\mathrm{S} / \\mathrm{N}$ achieved by the MRS data, so all statistical uncertainties in the cross-observatory comparison are solely dominated by the JWST rather than ALMA data."

We re-image the rest- $120 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$ data following the same procedure as the $160 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$ data to produce an image with identical spatial resolution and pixel scale. We convert the $120 \\mu \\mathrm{~m} / 160 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$ flux ratio to an equivalent estimate of $\\mathrm{T}_{\\text {dust }}$ by assuming that the dust continuum emission follows a standard modified blackbody function with Rayleigh-Jeans slope index $\\beta=2$ and unity optical depth wavelength $\\lambda_{0}=100 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$. These images are shown in Extended Data Figure 2. We see no evidence that the regions of brightest emission are also preferentially warmer than the rest of the source. The largest variations arise in the faintest pixels, suggesting that instrumental noise is plausibly responsible for the variations we see.\n\nAt least at the spatial resolution of the MRS data, we find only small variations in $\\mathrm{T}_{\\text {dust }}$ across the source. We further examine the implications of the $\\mathrm{T}_{\\text {dust }}$ variations by calculating a 'corrected' conversion factor between $\\mathrm{L}_{\\text {IR }}$ and $160 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$ flux density. Pixels with high $120 \\mu \\mathrm{~m} / 160 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$ flux ratios (high $\\mathrm{T}_{\\text {dust }}$ ) will have higher $\\mathrm{L}_{\\text {IR }}$ for a given amount of $160 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$ flux density. Extended Data Figure 2 (right) shows the results of this test in comparison to our default assumption of a constant conversion factor. In agreement with the relatively small implied variations in dust temperature from the ALMA maps, we find only very small $\\sim 10 \\%$ corrections to our default assumption. These changes are minor in comparison to other sources of uncertainty in our analysis such as the relatively low $\\mathrm{S} / \\mathrm{N}$ in the $3.3 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$ PAH data.

It is possible these two factors conspire to produce an artificial distribution in, for example, the $\\mathrm{L}_{\\text {PAH }} / \\mathrm{L}_{\\text {IR }}$ ratio map (Fig. 3). We tested this scenario by constructing mock MRS cubes in which $\\mathrm{L}_{\\text {PAH }}$ perfectly traces $\\mathrm{L}_{\\text {IR }}$ on resolved scales, i.e. assuming a constant $\\mathrm{L}_{\\text {PAH }} / \\mathrm{L}_{\\text {IR }}$ ratio across the source.
