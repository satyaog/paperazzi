To date, it has been unclear if different DNA entities could be associated with Leishmania EVs and whether these could constitute a mechanism of horizontal gene transfer (HGT). Herein, we investigate the DNA content of EVs derived from drug-resistant parasites, as well as the EVs' potential to act as shuttles for DNA transfer. Next-generation sequencing and PCR assays confirm the enrichment of amplicons carrying drug-resistance genes associated with EVs. Transfer assays of drug-resistant EVs highlight a significant impact on the phenotype of recipient parasites induced by the expression of the transferred DNA. Recipient parasites display an enhanced growth and better control of oxidative stress. We provide evidence that eukaryotic EVs function as efficient mediators in HGT, thereby facilitating the transmission of drug-resistance genes and increasing the fitness of cells when encountering stressful environments.\n\n## INTRODUCTION\n\nParasitic infectious diseases remain real and pervasive threats worldwide. The situation has worsened in recent decades due to the emergence and spread of drug resistance. In particular, the vector-borne parasite Leishmania affects 15 million people worldwide, and in the absence of effective preventive and therapeutic treatments, is spreading with almost 1.5 million new cases every year (Fernández-Prada et al., 2019). Control of the disease is based on a very short list of chemotherapeutic agents headed by antimonial drugs (Sb), followed by miltefosine (MF) and amphotericin B (AmB). These drugs are far from ideal due to host toxicity, limited access, and high rates of drug resistance (Fer-nández-Prada et al., 2019; Sundar and Singh, 2018).\n\nOne of the most striking evolutionary features of Leishmania is the lability of its genomic architecture, which can be conveniently restructured to rapidly counter stressors such as drug pressure (Bussotti et al., 2018; Leprohon et al., 2009; Ubeda et al., 2008). As Leishmania is an early divergent eukaryote, it lacks classic transcriptional control mechanisms. Leishmania parasites mostly rely on aneuploidy and DNA copy number variations (CNVs) for regulation of the expression of drug targets, stressrelated genes, and drug-resistance genes (Leprohon et al.,\n\n2009; Ubeda et al., 2014). Increases in CNVs in drug-resistant Leishmania parasites are frequently caused by the reversible accumulation of small extrachromosomal amplifications (i.e., amplicons) containing drug-resistance genes. These are generated through homologous recombination events between direct repeated sequence elements (producing circular amplicons) or inverted ones (producing linear amplicons), when Leishmania is exposed to stressful environmental conditions (El Fadili et al., 2005; Guimond et al., 2003; Leprohon et al., 2009; Ubeda et al., 2008, 2014). Of note, the presence of extrachromosomal episomes has been repeatedly confirmed in both in vitro-generated drug-resistant strains and field isolates (Downing et al., 2011; Leprohon et al., 2009; Mukherjee et al., 2007; Tripp et al., 1991; Ubeda et al., 2008, 2014).\nExtracellular vesicles (EVs) are nanometric membraneenclosed particles released into the extracellular space by organisms belonging to almost all living kingdoms; they serve as mediators of intercellular communication (Dong et al., 2021; Yá-ñez-Mó et al., 2015). In this way, EVs have emerged as key players in Leishmania biology by leading to, inter alia, an enrichment of parasite populations with key virulence factors (i.e., GP63) during the first moments of infection, promotion of parasite survival, or the triggering of an exacerbation of the disease"

Recently, our group made the discovery that small EVs contain specific protein signatures reflecting the drug-resistance profile of the parental Leishmania strain from which they originate (Douanne et al., 2020a). Moreover, we showed that Leishmania EVs can serve as a viral envelope for the endovirus Leishmania RNA virus 1 (LRV1), facilitating virus transmission and increasing infectivity in the mammalian host (Atayde et al., 2019).\n\nThese two seminal findings prompted us to explore whether EVs could be involved in the acquisition of drug-resistance genes through horizontal transfer events. Herein, we provide evidence that EVs released by drug-resistant Leishmania parasites are enriched in genomic regions containing genes involved in drug resistance. Moreover, we show that those circular amplifications containing drug-resistance genes can exploit EVs to guarantee efficient propagation into naive, drug-sensitive parasites (both intra- and interspecies), leading to the rapid emergence of drug-resistant subpopulations. This biological mechanism, coupled with Leishmania's genomic plasticity, could contribute to a rapid genomic diversification of a parasite population, while promoting rapid fitness gains in hostile environments.\n\n## RESULTS\n\nEV DNA is highly enriched in drug-resistance genes reflecting the parental parasite\nFrom our recent study showing that Leishmania EVs can serve as a cell-to-cell shuttle for double-stranded RNA viruses (Atayde et al., 2019), we hypothesized that this could also be the case for genes encoding proteins involved in drug resistance in Leishmania. To prove this, we selected a panel of drug-sensitive and drug-resistant strains belonging to L. infantum and L. major (Figure 1). First, the various strains were analyzed in terms of drug sensitivity to confirm their previously reported phenotypes (Table S1). Next, EVs were purified and assessed in terms of size and distribution (Figure 1A), particle-to-protein ratio (Figure 1B), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (Figure 1C). For all strains, vesicle purifications yielded EVs mostly situated under the 200 nm threshold (Figure 1A), therefore corresponding to small EVs. The ratio of particles per microgram of protein was above $10^{11}$ for all the extractions, which corresponds to highly pure EV preparations (Bellotti et al., 2021) (Figure 1B). TEM experiments revealed EV preparations to be free of contaminants and homogeneous in size (Figure 1C).\n\nTo confirm whether leishmanial EVs could serve as amplicon \"carriers,\" we isolated and characterized the DNA associated with the EVs released by the L. infantum wild type (Ldi WT) and the L. infantum Sb2000.1 (Ldi Sb) strains, the latter known to be equipped with a circular amplicon containing the $m r p A$ gene (responsible for Sb resistance). DNA was recovered from EVs of three independent cultures of Ldi WT and Ldi Sb and analyzed by DNA sequencing (DNA-seq) using short-read Illumina sequencing (Data S1). Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) was also performed to generate high-coverage comparative datasets for the EV DNA analysis. The reads were aligned on the LINF reference genome assembly and a differential abundance analysis was performed by comparing the normalized read coverage in Ldi Sb and Ldi WT for 5 kb genomic intervals, tilling each chromosome. This analysis highlights some CNVs at the genomic level (Figure 2A; outer circle), which are also reflected in the DNA recovered from EVs (inner circle). For example, as shown on the Miami plot representation of chromosome LinJ6 (Figures S1A and S1B), the terminal portion exhibits a 5-fold amplification in Ldi WT. In contrast, a segment of LinJ17 (between 157 and 193 kb ) was depleted in the WT strain (Figures S1C and S1D). As expected, the WGS analysis detected the previously described mrpA-containing amplicon stemming from LinJ23, with an $\\sim 30$-fold increased coverage in Ldi Sb parasites (Figures 2B and 2C). Importantly, the DNA isolated from EVs of Sb-resistant parasites also exhibited a similar increase in sequence coverage over this $\\sim 16 \\mathrm{~kb}$ region (Figures 2B and 2C).\n\nTo validate our DNA-seq findings, we conducted a series of PCR experiments targeting either the 4.7 kb mrpA complete open reading frame (ORF) or a 1.8 kb DNA fragment resulting from a homologous recombination event during the formation of the extrachromosomal circular DNA (Figure 2D), and thus absent from the sequence of the chromosomal locus (Leprohon et al., 2009). As shown in Figure 2E, the mrpA gene was amplified when using both total DNA and EV DNA from the Sb2000.1 strain as a template, but only from the genomic DNA recovered from Ldi WT (Figure 2E). However, the amplicon junction was detectable only in DNA isolated from the Sb-resistant strain (in both total DNA and EV DNA; Figure 2E), further confirming the presence of this extrachromosomal element in drug-resistant EVs. Finally, we evaluated whether the relationship of EVs and the mrpA-containing amplicon was restricted to the surface of the vesicles or, if at the same time, these extrachromosomal elements could be protected inside the particles. EVs derived from the WT and Sb2000.1 strains were subjected to a DNase I treatment prior to DNA isolation (Figure S1E) and then subjected to DNA-seq. As shown in Figure S1E, the $\\sim 16 \\mathrm{~kb}$ region containing the $m r p A$ gene not only was detected but remained highly enriched in Sb2000.1 EVs after DNase I treatment.\n\n## Leishmania EVs serve as an efficient mechanism of gene transfer\n\nOnce extrachromosomal amplicon-EV association was confirmed, we explored whether these particles could be involved in intraspecies horizontal gene transfer (HGT) and interspecies gene transfer (IGT) events in promastigotes. We first evaluated the ability of EV-driven HGT to influence recipient cell phenotypes in L. infantum strains. To this end, we exposed a Sb-hypersensitive strain of L. infantum (Ldi mrpA ${ }^{-/-}$) (Douanne et al., 2020b) to EVs released by the L. infantum Sb-resistant strain Sb2000.1, by means of three different experimental approaches (Figure S2). We performed Transwell experiments with Sb2000.1 or Ldi mrpA ${ }^{-/-}$promastigotes as EV donor cells, and Ldi mrpA ${ }^{-/-}$were recipient cells. The $0.4 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$ pores in the insert membrane prohibit the movement of parasites but permit the diffusion of released EVs from the upper chamber to the lower compartment. No Sb was present in the medium during this process. After 7 days of culture, recipient cells were recovered and submitted to dose-response assays in the presence of increasing concentrations of Sb . As depicted in Figure 3A,"

For the last approach, drug-resistant EVs were used as the transfection substrate. Once transfected with Sb2000.1 EVs, Ldi mrpA ${ }^{-/-}$recipient parasites were subjected to Sb-drug pressure for one passage ( 7 days of stabilization) and then tested with dose-response curves. Direct delivery of EV content inside the cell nucleus, coupled with a positive selection, led to high levels of drug resistance in the parasites exposed to Sb2000.1 EVs (Figure 3E), with a $>8$-fold increase in the $\\mathrm{EC}_{50}$ (Figure 3F). To further confirm the success of the HGT event, and since the recipient cell line was null for mrpA, we proceeded to the extraction of total DNA from recipient parasites after their exposure to EVs and conducted a PCR amplification targeting the complete coding sequence of mrpA. As depicted in Figure 3G, PCR led to the amplification of the expected $\\sim 4.7 \\mathrm{~kb}$ product corresponding to the mrpA ORF in all three Ldi mrpA ${ }^{-/-}$ recipient populations (Transwell, pure EVs, and nucleofection; Figure 3G). To further verify that these findings were not restricted to the mrpA null mutant-and assess whether the transferred DNA was being transcribed by the recipient cellswe exposed Ldi WT promastigotes to a single dose of WT- or Sb2000.1-purified EVs and recovered the total RNA on the fifth day after exposure. As expected, mrpA RNA levels were significantly increased (Figure S3), which supports the drug-resistant phenotype observed after exposure to drug-resistant small EVs.\n\nNext, we explored the potential involvement of EVs in IGT. To this end, we used L. infantum (Ldi) and L. major (LV39) WT strains, as well as an L. major strain resistant to methotrexate (MTX) (LV39 MTX60.4), which contains an extrachromosomal circular amplicon (result of a homologous recombination event, as schematized in Figure 4A) comprising the dihydrofolate reductase-thymidylate synthase (DHFR-TS) locus, known to be the main target of MTX (Ubeda et al., 2008). First, we conducted a series of PCR experiments targeting the homologous-recombination junction that is present only in the amplicon, and not in the chromosomal sequence. The amplicon signal was detected in the total DNA of only LV39 MTX60.4, as well as being associated with the vesicles of the MTX-resistant strain (Figure 4B). Naive cultures of both L. major WT and L. infantum WT parasites were exposed to LV39 MTX60.4 through Transwell assays, direct exposure to purified EVs, and nucleofection experiments. After Transwell assays, both L. major and L. infantum recipient parasites showed a significantly enhanced ability to survive in the presence of higher concentrations of MTX (Figure 4C), with\nan $\\sim 1.4$-fold shift in their $\\mathrm{EC}_{50}$ value (Figure 4D). Likewise, recipient parasites exposed to EVs purified from the LV39 MTX60.4 were also able to better survive in the presence of MTX (Figure 4E), with $\\sim 4$-fold (L. major) and $\\sim 2.5$-fold (L. infantum) increases in their $\\mathrm{EC}_{50}$ values (Figure 4F). Finally, as previously demonstrated for the mrpA amplicon, direct nucleofection of pure EVs led to very high levels of resistance to MTX in both L. infantum and L. major recipient parasites (Figure 4G), with a $>8$-fold increase in their $\\mathrm{EC}_{50}$ value (Figure 4H).\n\n## Plasmids containing foreign elements can efficiently propagate through small EVs\n\nWe further explored the efficiency of HGT events by using a synthetic plasmid carrying the coding sequences of two different markers: the mCherry gene and the blasticidin-resistance gene (BSD) (Figure 5A). The BSD-mCherry plasmid was transfected as a circular episome in the L. infantum WT background, and both parasite DNA and EV DNA were recovered on passage 3 after the transfection. PCR analysis targeting the 399 bp sequence of the BSD showed a positive amplification in both total parasite DNA and EV DNA of the novel Ldi BSD-mCherry strain (Figure 5B). In this case, because of the presence of these two markers, we were able to evaluate both the impact in terms of blasticidin sensitivity and the success of plasmid transfer by the evaluation of mCherry-derived red fluorescence. As shown with amplicon EV experiments, recipient naive parasites exposed to Ldi BSD-mCherry EVs through Transwell assays (Figure 5C), direct contact (Figure 5E), and nucleofection (Figure 5G) increased their capacity to survive in the presence of high concentrations of blasticidin by $\\sim 1.5$ - (Figure 5D), $\\sim 3.0$ (Figure 5F), and $>8$-fold (Figure 5H), respectively. All three recipient populations exhibited a positive result when tested for the presence of the BSD gene by PCR (Figure S4).\n\nWe next evaluated the time required to observe red parasites (i.e., expression of the transferred genes) after the exposure of recipient naive parasites to BSD-mCherry purified EVs. As shown in Figure S5, no fluorescence was detected in the initial moments; recipient parasites began to express the mCherry protein around 48 h post-exposure. Signal was greatly increased $96-120 \\mathrm{~h}$ after initial exposure. Of note, these experiments were conducted in blasticidin-free medium, so no drug pressure was driving the selection of the mCherry subpopulation. Next, we compared the success of transmission of the BSD-mCherry plasmid to recipient WT parasites using Transwell assays, purified EVs, and direct transfection of EVs (Figure 6). The efficiency of transfer followed the same order as previously seen in terms of\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    Figure 3.

Simultaneous quantification of the total fluorescence signal normalized by the number of parasites showed similar results; with transfer efficiency levels approximately two times higher when using purified EVs (signal corresponding to $\\sim 20 \\%$ of the total population compared with the donor Ldi BSD-mCherry strain) than with Transwell assays ( $\\sim 11 \\%$ of the population) after 120 h of exposure (Figure S6). As expected, nucleofection using purified BSD-mCherry EVs resulted in a very strong ( $\\sim 93 \\%$ of the population) fluorescence phenotype (Figures 6 and S6). Of note, parasites incubated in the presence of the \"naked\" (no EVs) plasmids did not show any mCherry fluorescence signal (Figures 6 and S6), further supporting the importance of small EVs to guarantee the uptake of the DNA of interest.\n\nEVs released by drug-resistant parasites contribute to reducing cellular stress and stimulate cell proliferation Using Transwell assays, we evaluated the impact of EVs released by different drug-resistant Leishmania strains on the drug cross-sensitivity profiles of naive recipient cells. EVs released by Sb- and AmB-resistant strains caused a reduction in the sensitivity of the WT strain against Sb (Figure 7A). EVs released by the AmB-resistant strain induced a slight but significant reduction in the sensitivity against MF (Figure 7B). Exposure to particles released by the AmB- and MF-resistant strains resulted in decreased sensitivity against AmB (Figure 7C). We next studied the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) upon drug exposure and the impact of EVs in this process. To this end, L. infantum-sensitive parasites were exposed to the $\\mathrm{EC}_{90}$ of Sb , MF , and AmB in the presence, or the absence, of purified EVs released by the WT, Sb2000.1, MF200.5, and AmB1000.1 strains (Figure 7D). Detection of dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCFDA) fluorescence confirmed lower levels of ROS production/accumulation in WT promastigotes exposed to EVs derived from drug-resistant strains compared with unexposed parasites. EVs released by the WT did not confer any protection against ROS. As expected, protection against ROS translated into significantly higher survival rates in promastigotes exposed to EVs released by drug-resistant parasites (Figure 7D). Next, we evaluated the impact of EVs released by the WT and the drug-resistant strains on the growth pattern of drug-sensitive parasites in the absence (Figure 7E) or presence of drug-induced stress (Figures 7F and 7H). EVs released by drug-resistant parasites, but not those of the WT, significantly increased the growth of sensitive recipient parasites (Figure 7E). Moreover, Sb2000.1- and AmB1000.1derived EVs fostered a greater growth of WT parasites under drug pressure (Figures 7F and 7H, respectively). On the other hand, the effect of MF-derived EVs on parasite growth, while significant, was milder and transient (Figure 7G).\n\nFinally, to better understand the differences in terms of cell growth, we explored potential changes in the proteome of Ldi WT recipient promastigotes after 120 h exposure to Sb -resistant Leishmania EVs compared with the WT's own EVs. Shotgun proteomics revealed four proteins detected in the whole-parasite proteome of only the three replicates of WT parasites exposed to Sb -resistant EVs and not in all three replicates exposed to WT-EV (Figures S7A and S6C and Data S2). Among these unique proteins found in the parasites, we identified two dehydrogenase proteins, one involved in the oxidation of malate to oxaloacetate (A4I9I4_LEIIN) and one involved in succinate converting to fumarate (A4HWJ7_LEIIN). In addition, we identified a putative Peter Pan protein (A4HRX6_LEIIN), which could be involved in cellular division and cell-cycle progression. On the other hand, as summarized in the volcano plot (Figure S7B), we identified 17 upregulated ( $p<0.05$; fold change $\\geq 2$ ) and 4 downregulated proteins ( $p<0.05$; fold change $\\leq 0.5$ ). Among the enriched proteins (Figure S7C) in WT parasites exposed to Sb2000.1 EVs, we identified an enoyl-CoA hydratase (E9AHU0_LEIIN), a farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase (E9AH04_LEIIN), a member of the endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT) pathway VPS23 (A4I7R5_LEIIN), and a dynein-associated protein (A4IB75_LEIIN).\n\n## DISCUSSION\n\nDrug resistance in Leishmania continues to emerge, diversify, and spread (Fernández-Prada et al., 2019). While the effect of antileishmanial drugs on host-infecting amastigotes has been largely studied, interest in the propagation of drug-resistance traits in the sand fly vector has only recently drawn the attention of the scientific community (Van Bockstal et al., 2020). Of note, Leishmania can undergo genetic exchange during growth and development in the sand fly vector through cryptic sex. However, the occurrence of viable hybrid offspring is variable depending on the experimental conditions (Akopyants et al., 2009; Louradour et al., 2020, 2022; Monte-Neto et al., 2022). Alternatively, acquisition of genes via HGT in the vector would represent an efficient and less challenging mechanism of genetic exchange by facilitating a rapid genome diversification. However, such a mechanism had never been described in eukaryotic parasites before. Moreover, and to guarantee efficient HGT, DNA should be protected from degradation during its cell-to-cell transit. In this way, we recently showed that Leishmania EVs are naturally secreted in the vector (Atayde et al., 2015), and they serve as an envelope for LRV1 virions (Atayde et al., 2019). This points to EVs as potential shuttles for nucleic acid transfer in Leishmania.\n\nThe first question we addressed in this work was the potential occurrence of specific leishmanial DNA associated with EVs,\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    (D) $\\mathrm{EC}_{50}$ fold-change comparison between conditions depicted in (C).\n    (E) Dose-response assays in recipient parasites after exposure to purified EVs.\n    (F) $\\mathrm{EC}_{50}$ fold-change comparison between conditions depicted in (E).\n    (G) Dose-response assays in recipient parasites after their nucleofection and selection with purified EVs.\n    (H) $\\mathrm{EC}_{50}$ fold-change comparison between conditions depicted in (G).

      "markdown": "and whether this EV DNA could vary depending on the drugresistance background of the parasite. Numerous studies have reported the presence of DNA both attached to the surface of tumor-derived EVs and in their lumen (Elzanowska et al., 2021). Likewise, a recent metagenomic study showed the presence of antibiotic-resistance genes in bacterial EVs in indoor dust (Qin et al., 2022). Our EV DNA-seq experiments revealed that fragments from almost the entire genome of L. infantum WT and Sb2000.1 strains were represented in their respective small EVs. EV-DNA genomic fragments could represent a highly diverse source of gene CNVs, which are a well-established mechanism of genetic adaption in Leishmania (Leprohon et al., 2015). Indeed, when encountering a stressor (i.e., drug pressure or physical stress such as temperature), the subset of parasites with increased CNVs-leading to increased expression of genes involved in countering the challenge-would survive. Of note, EV-driven CNVs could contribute to a rapid genetic diversification of the population in the sand fly vector, as well as inducing rapid fitness gains to effectively respond to environmental signals and stressors in the absence of regulated transcription (Grünebast and Clos, 2020). Likewise, tumor-derived EVs are known to contain double-stranded genomic DNA spanning all chromosomes (reflecting the genetic status of the tumor, i.e., single-nucleotide polymorphisms [SNPs] and CNVs) (Balaj et al., 2011; Kahlert et al., 2014; Vagner et al., 2018) and could potentially participate in the process of cancer metastasis and drug resistance (Zhang et al., 2018). Our analyses pinpointed a major enrichment of EV DNA corresponding to the region encoding the $m r p A$ gene on chromosome LinJ23, reflecting the genetic background of the Sb2000.1 strain (Leprohon et al., 2009), and thus pointing to a potential transfer of resistance. Of note, the presence of the $m r p A$ amplicon was not restricted to the exofacial surface of Sb2000.1 EVs, given that the same amplification was detected by DNA-seq after DNase treatment. This, in fact, could confer increased stability to the amplicon by protecting it from the external environment during an HGT event. Due to their size, small EVs ( $<200 \\mathrm{~nm}$ ) can transport a limited amount of material in their lumen. However, the presence of dsDNA fragments ranging from 100 bp to 20 kb has been confirmed in small EVs (i.e., exosomes) released by tumor cells (Kahlert et al., 2014; Lee et al., 2016), further substantiating our findings of an $\\sim 16$ kb mrpA amplification in Leishmania EVs. That said, the mechanism of DNA packaging in uptake by EVs remains unclear (Elzanowska et al., 2021). During each mitotic division the nucleus disassembles and re-forms, releasing nuclear content into the cytoplasm. Since the ESCRT pathway participates in both membrane abscission during cytokinesis and regeneration of the nu-\nclear envelope (Stoten and Carlton, 2018), this could represent the most favorable moment for amplicon uptake by Leishmania EVs.\n\nNext, we demonstrated, through three different approaches, that EVs released by drug-resistant parasites can efficiently alter the drug-sensitivity phenotype of recipient parasites after a single exposure, through the transmission of natural amplicons (i.e., $m r p A$ and $D H F R$ genes) or artificial plasmids (i.e., BSD). Moreover, this observation was conserved, and gene transfers were functional between visceral and cutaneous leishmaniasis species as demonstrated by MTX-resistance transfer from L. major MTX60.4 to L. infantum parasites. Likewise, genomic exchange through interspecies-hybrid formation has been recently reported both in vitro and in the sand fly vector (Louradour et al., 2022; Romano et al., 2014). Importantly, we showed that, when exposing naive parasites to purified drug-resistant EVs, levels of drug sensitivity in the recipient cells were increased by 2- to 3 -fold after a single exposure. While less efficient, continuous exposure in Transwell co-culture experiments also led to a significant decrease in drug sensitivity in recipient parasites. Similarly, Pereira and co-workers showed that co-culture of Sb-resistant and Sb-sensitive Leishmania strains recovered from patients resulted in an improvement in growth capacity and an increased resistance of sensitive parasites (Pereira et al., 2021). While they did not identify the mechanism underlying these phenotypic changes, their observational results further reinforce our mechanistic findings. In addition, this could have major clinical implications: increased $\\mathrm{EC}_{50}$ values will translate to poor, or even ineffective, treatment response in leishmaniasis patients (Pereira et al., 2021).\n\nOur most striking evidence of HGT events was the demonstration of the efficient transfer of the extrachromosomally amplified genes $m r p A$ and $B S D$ into the naive background of recipient $m r p A^{-/-}$and WT L. infantum strains after exposure to donor EVs. While a few reports have recently described the gene transfer potential of outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) of Gram-negative bacteria (Dell'Annunziata et al., 2021), we now demonstrate HGT in eukaryotic parasites through EVs. While leishmanial amplicons share some similarities with prokaryotic plasmids (i.e., circular architecture and multi-gene content), Leishmania extrachromosomal DNAs do not include any genetic factor known to facilitate their transfer among parasites (Beverley, 1991). However, this evolutionary limitation could have been circumvented by EVs, which, as supported by our findings, would facilitate the diffusion of genetic elements to surrounding parasites, as we also showed previously for LRV1 (Atayde et al., 2019). In addition to being a very efficient source of genetic diversity, EV DNA\n\nFigure 5.

On the other hand, this new EV-driven genetic-exchange mechanism implies that drug resistance could spread in sand fly populations, even in the absence of drug pressure.\n\nExpression of proteins encoded by EV-transferred genes took up to 72 h , as per detection of mCherry reporter fluorescence emission. This delay in detection further corroborates the transmission of mCherry DNA, rather than the protein, and sheds some light on the time required for the release of EV-DNA cargo into the cytoplasm of recipient parasites and subsequent intracellular trafficking to their nucleus. To this extent, different studies have shown that plasmids use the microtubule network and the retrograde motor dynein to reach the cell nucleus after transfection in eukaryotic cells (Vaughan and Dean, 2006). Likewise, our proteomic analyses revealed a significant enrichment in dynein-associated proteins in parasites exposed to EVs containing drug-resistance amplicons (i.e., WT exposed to Sb2000.1 EVs for 120 h). However, further studies are needed to better understand DNA vesicular absorption mechanisms. In addition, we showed that EV-mediated genetic-exchange events could be efficient in Leishmania, as a single exposure to EVs led to a transformation of $\\sim 20 \\%$ of the population in the absence of any selection pressure. This HGT efficiency rate is comparable to that reported in L. major-L. major hybrid selection experiments ( $7 \\%-26 \\%$ ) in the sand fly vector (Akopyants et al., 2009; Monte-Neto et al., 2022). Whether both mechanisms are linked should be addressed in future studies.\n\nTo succeed through its parasitic life cycle, resistance-conferring genetic alterations must guarantee the survival of the parasite under stressors not only in the mammalian host but also inside the sand fly vector (Van Bockstal et al., 2020). Several reports have shown that drug-resistant Leishmania parasites are more tolerant when exposed to different stressors (i.e., starvation, heat shock-pH stress, etc.) (Berg et al., 2015). Thus, we explored the potential involvement of EVs released by donor drug-resistant parasites in the modulation of redox control and tolerance to stress in naive recipient parasites. To this end, we verified potential mechanisms of cross-resistance when exposing sensitive recipient parasites to EVs issued by parasites resistant to the three main antileishmanial drugs. We confirmed a cross-resistant phenotype between AmB and MF (Fernandez-Prada et al., 2016) previously reported, and we pinpointed a previously unknown cross-resistance to Sb when parasites were exposed to AmB1000.1 EVs. This could be explained by the enrichment of AmB1000.1 EVs with MRPA protein, as described in our previous EV proteomics studies (Douanne et al., 2020a). Of note, we showed that WT receiving EVs from drug-resistant parasites were able to grow better and survive for longer in a non-drugged environment. Increased growth rate was coupled to a better tolerance toward, or reduced pro-\nduction of, ROS when parasites were exposed to high concentrations of various antileishmanial drugs. This enhanced ability to neutralize drug-induced ROS production was not transferred by WT EVs, which is in line with previous metabolomic studies showing that drug-resistant parasites are protected against drug-induced oxidative stress as part of a general adaptation mechanism that is independent of the drug toward which the parasite has become resistant (Berg et al., 2015).\n\nNext, we explored the potential reprogramming of Leishmania's proteome during its stationary phase (fifth day of growth) after an initial, single-dose exposure to EVs released by drugresistant parasites. Patterns of protein expression of recipient parasites exposed to EVs changed according to the drug-resistance background of the donor cell. Among the proteins detected only in parasites exposed to Sb2000.1 EVs, we identified succinate and malate dehydrogenases, both known to be potentially involved in promastigote growth and metacyclogenesis. Succinate dehydrogenase (mitochondrial complex II) may be of particular importance, as succinate is the main trypanosomatid respiratory substrate (Verner et al., 2014). In eukaryotic cells, complex II can be a source as well as a suppressor of ROS, and its processes are highly linked to the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. Among TCA-cycle intermediates, oxaloacetate (a product of malate dehydrogenase) can efficiently inhibit complex II and minimize superoxide production (Dröse, 2013). This could explain the protective effect of Sb -resistant EVs against ROS formation, as well as the enhanced growth observed in recipient parasites. Likewise, enrichment in enoyl-CoA hydratase and farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase could translate into enhanced growth, as these are two key intermediates in the biosynthesis of all isoprenoids, which are precursors of many end-products that are essential for cell viability. Farnesyl pyrophosphate is used by trypanosomatids in the biosynthesis of dolichol and sterols, such as ergosterol, and in protein prenylation (Gadelha et al., 2020). Finally, the presence of VPS23 protein, belonging to ESCRT-II, coupled to the enrichment of a dynein-associated protein could reflect an increased rate of cellular division, as vesiculation contributes to membrane abscission during cytokinesis (Stoten and Carlton, 2018). Future work should address the functionality (i.e., enzymatic activity) of these altered pathways and further elucidate the signaling cascade leading to their enrichment in naive parasites after exposure to drug-resistant EVs.\n\nCollectively, our study reveals that Leishmania parasites exploit EVs to guarantee the propagation of drug-resistance genes as part of episomal amplifications, which constitutes a demonstration of EV-mediated HGT in eukaryotic parasites, as well as an alternative mechanism of drug resistance in eukaryotic cells. In addition, EVs derived from drug-resistant parasites modulate promastigote fitness by reducing the accumulation of ROS, when encountering stressors, and altering the basal proteome of recipient parasites, further guaranteeing the survival and propagation of drug-resistant populations.\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    (E) Parasite growth in the presence of purified EVs was measured (Cytation 5; $\\mathrm{OD}_{600}$ ) every 24 h for 6 days in drug-free media.\n    (F-H) Parasite growth in the presence of purified EVs was measured (Cytation 5; $\\mathrm{OD}_{600}$ ) every 24 h for 6 days in medium containing Sb, MF, or AmB.

Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) can be released to the extracellular space as cell-free mtDNA in association with EVs. The Ldi WT reference genome assembly does not include the kinetoplast DNA (mtDNA, or kDNA); hence, our analyses focused on the nuclear DNA, which contains the known drug-resistance genes. Further studies are also needed to elucidate the intracellular processes involved in packaging DNA into Leishmania EVs, and whether DNA structure and intracellular origin have a role in this process. Moreover, while we have proved the link between drug-resistance genes transferred through EVs (i.e., $m r p A, d h f r$, and $B S D$ ) and changes in the phenotype (i.e., decreased drug sensitivity) of recipient cells, EVs could contain molecules other than DNA (i.e., different thiol species) that could be contributing to survival against off-target or nonspecific stressors (i.e., cross-resistance through increased protection against ROS). Finally, it also remains to be determined how the HGT and IGT mechanisms proposed here will apply to other eukaryotic organisms under different physiological and stressful conditions.\n\n## STAR ■ METHODS\n\nDetailed methods are provided in the online version of this paper and include the following:\n\n- KEY RESOURCES TABLE\n- RESOURCE AVAILABILITY\n- Lead contact\n- Materials availability\n- Data and code availability\n- EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS\n- Leishmania cell lines\n- METHOD DETAILS\n- Drug sensitivity assays\n- Leishmania growth experiments\n- Generation of the L. infantum BSD-mCherry strain\n- Isolation and purification of Leishmania small EVs\n- Small EVs size and concentration measurements\n- Transmission electron microscopy (TEM)\n- Isolation of DNA from whole promastigotes and purified small EVs\n- DNA amplification and visualization\n- DNA sequencing and analysis\n- Transfer of EV-associated DNA\n- Measurement of reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation\n- LC-MS/MS\n- Database searching and protein identification\n- Proteomics analysis\n- QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS\n\n\n## SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION\n\nSupplemental information can be found online at https://doi.org/10.1016/j. celrep.2022.111121.\n\n## ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nThe authors want to thank Prof. Marc Ouellette for the kind gift of the L. infantum Sb2000.1, MF200.5, AmB1000.1, and L. major MTX60.4 drug-resistant strains.

Accession numbers are listed in the key resources table.\n\n- This paper does not report original code.\n- Any additional information required to reanalyze the data reported in this paper is available from the lead contact upon request.\n\n\n# EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS \n\n## Leishmania cell lines\n\nEight strains belonging to two different Leishmania species, L. infantum (belonging to the Leishmania donovani complex; Ld) and L. major, were used in this study. Leishmania infantum strains included: L. infantum (MHOM/MA/67/ITMAP-263) wild-type strain (WT) and the in vitro generated resistant mutants Sb2000.1, AmB1000.1 and MF200.5 (Brotherton et al., 2013, 2014; El Fadili et al., 2005; Fernandez-Prada et al., 2016; Leprohon et al., 2009; Moreira et al., 2011), which are resistant to antimony (Sb), amphotericin B (AmB), and miltefosine (MF), respectively. We also included an antimony-hypersensitive strain (Ldi-mrpA ${ }^{-/-}$) which lacks the gene encoding the ATP-binding cassette protein MRPA (Douanne et al., 2020b); and a strain overexpressing an episomal plasmid harboring the mCherry and blasticidin-resistance genes (BSD-mCherry). Leishmania major strains included: L. major LV39 wildtype strain (LV39 WT) and the in vitro generated methotrexate (MTX)-resistant mutant LV39 MTX60.4 (Ubeda et al., 2008).\n\nAll strains were grown at $25^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ in M199 medium supplemented with $10 \\%$ fetal bovine serum and $5 \\mu \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mL}$ of haemin at pH 7.0. Drugresistant strains were grown in the presence of the drug for which they were previously selected for resistance (except during DNAtransmission experiments and isolation of EVs): 2 mM Sb (Potassium antimony) tartrate, Sigma-Aldrich) for Sb2000.1; $200 \\mu \\mathrm{M}$ MF (Miltefosine, Cayman Chem.) for MF200.5; $1 \\mu \\mathrm{M} \\mathrm{AmB}$ (Amphotericin B solution, Sigma) for AmB1000.1; $60 \\mu \\mathrm{M}$ MTX (Methotrexate, Sigma-Aldrich); $120 \\mu \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mL}$ blasticidin (Blasticidin S hydrochloride, Sigma-Aldrich) for Ldi BSD-mCherry; and $100 \\mu \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mL}$ puromycin (Puromycin dihydrochloride, Wisent) for Ldi mrpA ${ }^{-/-}$.\n\n## METHOD DETAILS\n\n## Drug sensitivity assays\n\nAntileishmanial values were determined by monitoring the growth of promastigotes after 72 h of incubation at $25^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ in the presence of increasing drug concentrations of Sb, MF, AmB, MTX, or blasticidin, by measuring $\\mathrm{A}_{600}$ using a Cytation 5 machine (BioTek, USA). $\\mathrm{EC}_{50}$ values were calculated based on dose-response curves analyzed by non-linear regression with GraphPad Prism 8.0 software (GraphPad Software, La Jolla California, USA). An average of at least three independent biological replicates run in triplicate was performed for each determination. Before proceeding to purification of EVs, the different strains were analyzed in terms of drug sensitivity to confirm their previously reported phenotypes (Table S1).\n\n## Leishmania growth experiments\n\nGrowth curves were performed in $25 \\mathrm{~cm}^{2}$ cell culture flasks by seeding $1 \\times 10^{6}$ parasites $/ \\mathrm{mL}$, and parasite growth was determined daily, up to 5 days, by measuring $\\mathrm{A}_{600}$ using a Cytation 5 machine (BioTek, USA). Depending on the experimental conditions, parasites were exposed ( $5 \\mu \\mathrm{g} \\mathrm{EVs} / \\mathrm{mL}$ ) or not to purified small EVs in the presence or in the absence of the different antileishmanial drugs mentioned above ( $0 \\times$ or $1 \\times \\mathrm{EC}_{50}$ ). Growth assays were performed with at least three biological replicates from independent cultures, each of which included three technical replicates.\n\n## Generation of the L. infantum BSD-mCherry strain\n\nThe BSD-mCherry overexpressing mutant was generated by introducing the pLEXSY-mCherry plasmid in the L. infantum strain background as previously described (Calvo-Álvarez et al., 2014). Briefly, for episomal expression, a total of $20 \\mu \\mathrm{~g}$ of the circular pLEXSY-BSD-mCherry plasmid were transfected into L. infantum WT parasites by nucleofection using the Amaxa Nucleofector System (Lonza) customized for the Human T cell Nucleofector Kit (U-033 pre-set program). Selection was achieved in the presence of $120 \\mu \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mL}$ blasticidin S (Blasticidin S hydrochloride, Sigma-Aldrich). The phenotype of the resulting mutant was verified by both blasticidin drug-susceptibility tests and fluorescence microscopy (Texas Red Fluorescence Imaging (586-647 nm), Cytation 5 machine (BioTek, USA)).\n\n## Isolation and purification of Leishmania small EVs\n\nLeishmania small EVs were isolated and purified as we previously described (Atayde et al., 2019; Douanne et al., 2020a). Briefly, 1 L of Leishmania parasites ( $2.5-5.0 \\times 10^{6}$ parasites $/ \\mathrm{mL}$ ) was grown in drug-free M199 at $25^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ (supplemented with $10 \\%$ FBS and $5 \\mu \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mL}$ of haemin at pH 7.0 ) and left to divide in 10 non-ventilated $75 \\mathrm{~cm}^{2}$ culture flasks (Corning, USA) until they reached late-log phase. Next, parasites were washed twice in PBS and resuspended in 5 mL RPMI-1640 medium (no FBS, no phenol red) (Life Technologies) at a final concentration of $2.5-5.0 \\times 10^{6}$ parasites $/ \\mathrm{mL}$, in non-ventilated $25 \\mathrm{~cm}^{2}$ culture flasks (Corning, USA) at $37^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$. Parasites were stimulated for 4 h at $37^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ to maximize the release of EVs in the medium (Atayde et al., 2019; Douanne et al., 2020a). The viability of parasites was evaluated by propidium-iodide (PI) staining before and after incubation at $37^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$. Only cultures with a viability $>95.0 \\%$"

      "markdown": "were submitted to subsequent EV-purification steps. After the 4-h incubation, samples were centrifuged 10 min at 3000 g to eliminate parasites and 10 min at $8,500 \\mathrm{~g}$ to clear out debris, followed by two subsequent filtrations using 0.45 and $0.22 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$ syringe filters. EVs were then recovered by a 1 h ultracentrifugation at $100,000 \\mathrm{~g}$ using 17 mL polypropylene tubes ( $16 \\times 96 \\mathrm{~mm}$ ) in an SW 32 Ti SwingingBucket Rotor (Beckman Coulter, USA) and resuspended in EVs buffer ( $137 \\mathrm{mM} \\mathrm{NaCl}, 20 \\mathrm{mM}$ HEPES, pH 7.5). EV protein content was determined using the Micro BCA Protein Assay Kit (Pierce Biotechnology, USA) as per the manufacturer's recommendations. EVs were conserved in aliquots in EVs buffer at $-80^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ for subsequent experiments. Aliquots were slowly thawed on ice before being used (EVs were never refrozen). A minimum of three independent purifications were performed for each strain.\n\n# Small EVs size and concentration measurements \n\nSize and concentration measurements of the purified EV samples were performed with a ZetaView Nanoparticle tracking analyzer (NTA) (Particle Metrix, USA). The samples were run at $25^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ using $0.22 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$ filtered EVs buffer as a diluent. For video acquisition, a shutter frame rate of 45 was used and the sensitivity was set at 85 , according to the system's software guidance algorithms. Before measurements were taken, accuracy of the ZetaView was verified using 100 nm standard beads. Samples were diluted in EVs buffer with a dilution factor of 1:1,000-1:10,000 to achieve a particle count in the range of 1,000-2,000.\n\n## Transmission electron microscopy (TEM)\n\nTEM visualization of Leishmania small EVs was performed in accordance with our previously published method (Douanne et al., 2020a). Briefly, purified EVs were coated on formvar carbon grids, fixed with $1 \\%$ glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer for 1 min , and stained with $1 \\%$ uranyl acetate for 1 min . A FEI Tecnai $12120 \\mathrm{kV}$ transmission electron microscope was then used for recording the formvar grids coated with the purified EVs. The resulting images were captured with the AMT XR-80C CCD Camera System (Facility for Electron Microscopy Research, McGill University).\n\n## Isolation of DNA from whole promastigotes and purified small EVs\n\nGenomic DNAs were prepared from mid-log phase clonal cultures of promastigotes of each strain using DNAzol reagent (Invitrogen, USA), as recommended by the manufacturer. DNA was extracted using the DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit (QIAGEN, USA) from (i) purified EVs, or (ii) purified EVs after treatment with Turbo DNA-free (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA), following the manufacturer's instructions, to eliminate external DNA. Dried DNA pellets were resuspended in ddH2O and further concentrated using a Savant DNA SpeedVac Concentrator (Thermo Electron Corporation, USA). Purified DNAs were fluorometrically quantified using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) in a Take 3 platform (BioTek, USA). DNA was stored at $-20^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ until use in subsequent next generation sequencing or PCR experiments.\n\n## DNA amplification and visualization\n\nDNA targets (e.g., drug-resistance markers) were amplified from genomic DNA or small-EV associated DNA using compatible primer pairs (Table S2) in a ProFlex PCR System (Applied Biosystems, USA). PCR products were electrophoretically resolved in $1 \\times$ TBE, $0.6 \\%$ agarose gels stained with SYBR ${ }^{\\text {TM }}$ Safe DNA Gel Stain (Invitrogen, USA). Images were captured using a ChemiDoc MP Imaging System (BioRad, USA).\n\n## DNA sequencing and analysis\n\nExtracellular vesicle DNA libraries were constructed using the KAPA HyperPrep kit following the manufacturer's protocol without fragmentation; the final library fragment size was 250-400 bp. Sequencing was performed using an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 sequencer in a 50 bp pair-end configuration. An average 29-fold and 32-fold genome coverage was achieved for the EV DNA samples from the WT and the Sb-resistant mutant, respectively. Whole-genome DNA sequencing (WGS) libraries were prepared from genomic DNA with fragments $>40 \\mathrm{kbp}$, using the PCR-free Lucigen NxSeq library kit; the average library fragment size distribution was between 500 and 2,500bp. The WGS libraries were sequenced on an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 in a PE 100bp configuration, and a genome coverage of 208 -fold and 27 -fold was obtained for the WT and the Sb resistant mutant, respectively. Quality control analysis of the raw sequence reads was performed using FASTQC. Adapters and low-quality bases were trimmed by Trimmomatic (Bolger et al., 2014). Trimmed EV DNA sequences were mapped onto the Leishmania infantum reference genome assembly (LINF GCA_900500625.2) using the short-read aligner Bowtie2 (Langdon, 2015) using default parameters. For the WGS alignment, BWA-MEM was used with the default parameter, which supports the alignment of longer Illumina sequences ranging from 70 to 100bp (Li, 2013). Quality of mapping was analyzed using Qualimap (GarcíaAlcalde et al., 2012) and reads with low mapping quality score (MAPQ $\\leq 2$ ) were removed using Samtools (Li et al., 2009). PCR duplicates in EV DNA libraries were flagged and removed using Picard. Coverage tracks for the visualization in Integrated Genome Viewer (IGV) were created using deepTools (Ramírez et al., 2016), where the scaling factors were calculated using the following formula: genome size/(mapped read pairs * read length).\n\nFor the analysis of copy number variation (CNV), read depth coverage was calculated for 5-kb non-overlapping genomic windows tilling the 36 chromosomes using featureCounts (Liao et al., 2014). Read depth coverage was normalized based on the library size and the EVs DNA differential abundance analysis was performed using edgeR with exactTest method and Benjamini-Hochberg multiple testing correction (adjusted $p$ value threshold 0.05 ). Five-kb windows with a minimal coverage of 50 counts per million in at least"

To visualize the results of the CNV analyses, the circular and linear Miami plots were created using the CMplot package in R 3.5.3.\n\n# Transfer of EV-associated DNA \n\nThe ability of small EVs to transfer DNA to recipient cells was evaluated using three different approaches (Figure S2). For EVs Transwell co-culture (no contact) assays, donor parasites ( $2 \\times 10^{7}$ promastigotes in 1.5 mL ) were added to the $0.4 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$ poresize inside chamber (Corning, USA), while recipient parasites ( $5 \\times 10^{6}$ promastigotes in 2.6 mL ) were added to the wells as previously described (Atayde et al., 2019). Parasites were grown in drug-free M199 at $25^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ for 7 days. For direct transfer assays, particle preparations (a single dose of $10 \\mu \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mL}$ pure small EVs) were added to $10^{6}$ promastigotes $/ \\mathrm{mL}$ recipient parasite cultures in drug-free M199 at $25^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ for 7 days in 24 -well plates (Corning, USA). For EV-nucleofection experiments, a total of $15 \\mu \\mathrm{~g}$ of purified small EVs were directly transfected by nucleofection using the Amaxa Nucleofector System (Lonza) customized for the Human T cell Nucleofector Kit (U-033 program). Selection was achieved in the presence of the drug to which the donor parasites were resistant ( $25 \\mu \\mathrm{M} \\mathrm{Sb} ; 1 \\mu \\mathrm{M}$ MTX or $120 \\mu \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mL}$ blasticidin S). For all three experimental approaches, recipient parasites were recovered and submitted to different post-exposure tests (drug susceptibility, genomic DNA extraction or microscopy; Tables S3-S5). Experiments were performed with at least three biological replicates from independent cultures, each of which included three technical replicates.\n\n## Measurement of reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation\n\nIntracellular ROS accumulation was measured using the DCFDA dye (Invitrogen, USA). Briefly, $5 \\times 10^{7}$ mid-log L. infantum WT promastigotes were exposed to $5 \\mu \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mL}$ purified EVs for 3 h and then exposed to the $\\mathrm{EC}_{50}$ of the antileishmanial drugs (e.g., Sb, MF or AmB) for 48 h in M199 medium at $25^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ supplemented with $10 \\%$ fetal bovine serum and $5 \\mu \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mL}$ of haemin at pH 7.0 . Parasites were washed twice in Hepes- $\\mathrm{NaCl}(21 \\mathrm{mM}$ HEPES, $137 \\mathrm{mM} \\mathrm{NaCl}, 5 \\mathrm{mM} \\mathrm{KCl}, 0.7 \\mathrm{mM} \\mathrm{Na}_{2} \\mathrm{HPO}_{4} \\cdot 7 \\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{O}, 6 \\mathrm{mM}$ glucose, pH 7.4 ) and resuspended in $500 \\mu \\mathrm{~L}$ of Hepes- NaCl containing $25 \\mu \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mL}$ of $\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{DCFDA}$ (Invitrogen, USA). Parasites were then incubated in the dark for 30 min and washed twice with Hepes- NaCl . After washing, $200 \\mu \\mathrm{~L}$ of the promastigote resuspension was analyzed with a Cytation 5 machine (BioTek, USA) at 485 nm excitation and 535 nm emission wavelengths. Fluorescence was normalized with the number of living parasites determined by PI staining and manual counting. Experiments were performed with at least three biological replicates from independent cultures, each of which included three technical replicates.\n\n## LC-MS/MS\n\nLiquid chromatography-MS/MS was performed at the Institut de Recherches Cliniques de Montréal (IRCM, Université de Montréal, Canada). Twenty $\\mu \\mathrm{g}$ of proteins derived from late-logarithmic L. infantum promastigotes were precipitated with 15\\% trichloroacetic acid/acetone and processed as previously described (Atayde et al., 2019; Douanne et al., 2020a). Briefly, proteins were solubilized using a 6 M urea buffer, reduced by the addition of reduction buffer ( 45 mM DTT, 100 mM ammonium bicarbonate) for 30 min at $37^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$, and then by the addition of alkylation buffer ( 100 mM iodoacetamide, 100 mM ammonium bicarbonate) for 20 min at $24^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ in the dark. Subsequently, an in-solution digestion was performed by the addition of trypsin at a ratio of 1:25 protease/protein. After an overnight incubation at $37^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$, reactions were quenched by adding formic acid to a $0.2 \\%$ final concentration. Samples were cleaned with C18 Zip Tip pipette tips (Millipore, USA), eluates were dried down in a vacuum centrifuge and then re-solubilized under agitation for 15 min in 10 mL of $2 \\% \\mathrm{ACN} / 1 \\%$ formic acid. The column was installed on the Easy-LLC II system (Proxeon Biosystems, Odense, Denmark) and coupled to the LTQ Orbitrap Velos (ThermoFisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany) equipped with a Proxeon nanoelectrospray ion source. Proteomic experiments were performed with at least three biological replicates from independent cultures.\n\n## Database searching and protein identification\n\nAll MS/MS samples were analyzed using Mascot (Matrix Science, London, UK; version Mascot in Proteome Discoverer 2.4.0.305). Mascot was set up to search UniProt_Leishmania_Infantum_JPCM5, assuming the digestion enzyme trypsin. Mascot was searched with a fragment ion mass tolerance of 0.050 Da and a parent ion tolerance of 10.0 PPM. Carbamidomethyl of cysteine was specified in Mascot as a fixed modification, and oxidation of methionine as a variable modification. Next, validation of MS/MS-based peptide and protein identifications were performed using Scaffold (Scaffold_4.9.0 version, Proteome Software Inc., Portland, USA). Peptide identifications were accepted if they could be established at greater than $80.0 \\%$ probability by the Peptide Prophet algorithm. Protein identifications were accepted if they could be established at greater than $99.0 \\%$ probability and contained at least 2 identified peptides. Protein probabilities were assigned by the Protein Prophet algorithm. Proteins that contained similar peptides and could not be differentiated based on MS/MS analysis alone were grouped to satisfy the principles of parsimony. Finally, proteins sharing significant peptide evidence were grouped into clusters.\n\n## Proteomics analysis\n\nThe results of the LC-MS/MS were imported and normalized with the Scaffold (version 4.11.0) software. Only proteins with at least 2 normalized spectrum counts in a minimum of three samples were retained for downstream analyses. Protein information was completed with UniprotKB (UniProt, 2019) and TriTrypDB v46 (Aslett et al., 2010) databases. To identify differentially expressed proteins, an adjusted T test p value $<0.05$ and fold-change (FC) $\\geq 2$ for upregulated proteins and FC $\\leq 0.5$ for downregulated proteins"
