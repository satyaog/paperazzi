Chemical screening of primary human AML specimens by our group led to the identification of lipophilic statins as potent inhibitors of AMLs from a wide range of cytogenetic groups. Genetic screening to identify modulators of the statin response uncovered the role of protein geranylgeranylation and of RAB proteins, coordinating various aspect of vesicular trafficking, in mediating the effects of statins on AML cell viability. We further show that statins can inhibit vesicle-mediated transport in primary human specimens, and that statins sensitive samples show expression signatures reminiscent of enhanced vesicular trafficking. Overall, this study sheds light into the mechanism of action of statins in AML and identifies a novel vulnerability for cytogenetically diverse AML.\n\n## Introduction\n\nDespite many advances in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) therapy in recent years, this disease is still associated with poor prognosis. Early preclinical studies suggested that adaptation of cholesterol homeostasis represents 1 of the mechanisms contributing to chemoresistance in AML. ${ }^{1,2}$ Statins are competitive inhibitors of HMGCR, the rate-limiting enzyme in the mevalonate pathway. This pathway is involved in cholesterol biosynthesis and produces a variety of other bioactive compounds, most notably isoprenoids, required for intracellular signaling and vesicle-mediated trafficking, ${ }^{3}$ as well as coenzyme Q , which acts as an electron carrier in mitochondrial respiration. ${ }^{4}$\nThe effect of statins on AML cell survival has been predominantly studied using AML cell lines that do not completely recapitulate the disease and that poorly reflect the genetic heterogeneity of AML. Studies exploring the impact of statins on primary AML cells show a heterogeneity of responses ${ }^{5,6}$ and a possible association between poor prognosis and reduced statin sensitivity. ${ }^{5}$ To improve AML treatment outcomes, addition of pravastatin to standard induction chemotherapy has been explored, and results of a phase 1 study are encouraging. ${ }^{7}$ A phase 2 study of idarubicin and cytarabine in combination with\n\n[^0]The full-text version of this article contains a data supplement.\n(c) 2022 by The American Society of Hematology.

We uncovered vesicular trafficking as a key determinant of statin sensitivity in AML and as a novel vulnerability for this disease.\n\n## Methods\n\n## Primary human AML specimens and cell viability assays\n\nThis study was approved by the Research Ethics Boards of the University of Montréal and Maisonneuve-Rosemont Hospital. All samples were collected with informed consent and were annotated and cryopreserved at the Quebec Leukemia Cell Bank. Viability assays were performed as described. ${ }^{11}$\n\n## Whole-genome CRISPR/Cas9 screening\n\nScreening was performed as described. ${ }^{12,13}$\n\n## Endocytosis/pinocytosis assay\n\nSpecimens were treated with atorvastatin ( $1 \\mu \\mathrm{M}$ ) with or without geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate ( $2 \\mu \\mathrm{M}$ ) for 24 hours. Cells were exposed to dextran-fluorescein isothiocyanate or dextran-Pacific blue at $100 \\mu \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mL}$ for 30 minutes. Data were acquired using FACSCanto and analyzed using Diva software.\n\n## Results and discussion\n\n## Lipophilic statins are potent inhibitors of cytogenetically diverse AML\n\nWe previously interrogated a collection of 20 cytogenetically diverse primary human AML specimens (supplemental Table 1 screen 1) with a library of 5013 compounds ${ }^{11}$ and hits included statins (Figure 1A). Screening of an extended cohort of specimens ( $n=78$; supplemental Table 1 screen 2; supplemental Table 2) highlighted the dramatically reduced ability of pravastatin to inhibit AML cell viability compared with atorvastatin (Figure 1B). Statins differ in their import mechanism; whereas lipophilic statins such as atorvastatin mostly cross cell membranes by passive diffusion, hydrophilic statins like pravastatin mainly enter cells via carrier-mediated mechanisms. ${ }^{14}$ Interestingly, organic anion transporter proteins, responsible for pravastatin cellular uptake, are poorly transcribed in primary human AML specimens (Figure 1C), likely explaining the low pravastatin efficacy in AML cells in vitro.\nScreening of a cohort of 205 primary human AML specimens (supplemental Table 1 screen 3; supplemental Table 3) revealed median statin $50 \\%$ inhibitory concentrations in the nanomolar range\n(supplemental Figure 1A) and high correlation between responses to the different lipophilic statins across specimens (supplemental Figure 1B). Statin sensitivity was associated with lower marrow blast counts ( $P=.015$ ), but not with patient age, sex, or white blood cell counts (data not shown). Core binding factor [inv(16) and $t(8 ; 21)]$ AML and M4Eo AML by French-American-British classification also showed enhanced statin sensitivity (supplemental Figure 1C-D). Normal mobilized peripheral blood- or cord blood-derived $\\mathrm{CD} 34^{+}$and more primitive $\\mathrm{CD} 34^{+} \\mathrm{CD} 45 \\mathrm{RA}^{-}$cells, on the other hand, were characterized by reduced statin sensitivity compared with AML samples (supplemental Figure 1E). Overall, these results demonstrate that lipophilic statins are potent anti-AML agents.\n\n## Inhibition of RAB protein function mediates the anti-AML activity of statins\n\nInhibition of protein geranylgeranylation has been suggested to mediate inhibition of AML cell viability by statins. ${ }^{15,16}$ In support of this, short hairpin RNA-mediated knockdown of HMGCR and GGPS1 (Figure 1D) in OCI-AML5 cells indeed led to a an increase in statin sensitivity (Figure 1E), likely by rendering cells more dependent on the mevalonate pathway, as reported by others, ${ }^{17}$ whereas knockdown of the FDFT1 gene did not affect AML cell sensitivity to statins (Figure 1E). Synergy between treatment with atorvastatin and GGPS1 inhibitor TH-Z145 ${ }^{18}$ was also observed for inhibition of AML cell viability (Figure 1F; supplemental Figure 2).\nTo further dissect the statin response, we performed whole-genome CRISPR/Cas9 genetic screening in the NALM6 acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell line already optimized for CRISPR/Cas9 screening by our group ${ }^{12}$ and observed an overrepresentation of gene sets related to vesicle-mediated transport among genes showing synthetic lethal interactions with statin treatment (supplemental Figure 3), with RAB family genes (RAB1A, RAB1B, and RAB6A) and RAB activator TBC1D20 found to be among the most significant synthetic lethal interactions (Figure 1G; supplemental Table 4). Short hairpin RNA-mediated knockdown of RAB genes also sensitized AML cells to statins (supplemental Figure 4), suggesting that identified interactions are relevant to AML. Interestingly, RAB proteins are central coordinators of vesicular trafficking, ${ }^{19}$ requiring geranylgeranylation for membrane association and intrinsic activity, and knockouts of GGPS1 and of the 2 subunits of the RAB geranylgeranyltransferase (RABGGTA and RABGGTB) were found among most significant synthetic lethal interactions (Figure 1G). HMGCR knockout also showed a synthetic lethal interaction with statins (supplemental Table 4). Knockout of genes involved in cholesterol homeostasis (LDLR and LDLRAP1) as well as of the FDFT1 gene, on the other hand, rescued the effects of statins (Figure 1G). This could be explained by the inactivation of negative feedback loops normally induced by high cholesterol levels, ${ }^{20}$ leading to upregulation of the mevalonate pathway. Altogether, these results, along with the reported ability of statins to inhibit geranylgeranylation and membrane targeting of RAB proteins, ${ }^{21}$ suggest that inhibition of RAB\n\nFigure 1.

      "markdown": "specimens (Figure 2B), and among gene sets enriched in statinsensitive specimens compared with statin-resistant ones were found several related to vesicular trafficking (Figure 2B-C). These results suggest that statin-sensitive leukemias show enhanced vesicle-mediated trafficking, likely rendering them more vulnerable to inhibition of this process by statins and providing a possible explanation for the observed impact of vesicular trafficking regulator downregulation on statin sensitivity in AML.\nGenomic, chemical, and molecular approaches thus identified vesicle-mediated trafficking as a determinant of the statin response in AML and as a novel vulnerability in this disease. Targeting this process therefore represents a promising therapeutic avenue in AML, and these results suggest that clinical development of statins, so far mostly limited to pravastatin, and more particularly of potent lipophilic statins, might demonstrate benefits for AML treatment.\n\n## Acknowledgments\n\nThe authors thank Muriel Draoui for project coordination, Sophie Corneau for sample coordination, and Jean Duchaine and Karine Audette from the Institute for Research in Immunology and Cancer (IRIC) high-throughput screening platform for managing compound additions and data acquisition.
