Our goal is to minimize and quantify the regret (i.e. loss in performance) of our strategy with respect to an oracle who knows the system model. Viewing the interconnected subsystems globally and directly using existing LQG learning algorithms for the global system results in a regret that increases super-linearly with the number of subsystems. Instead, we propose a new Thompson sampling based learning algorithm which exploits the structure of the underlying network. We show that the expected regret of the proposed algorithm is bounded by $\\mathcal{O}(n \\sqrt{T})$ where $n$ is the number of subsystems, $T$ is the time horizon and the $\\mathcal{O}(\\cdot)$ notation hides logarithmic terms in $n$ and $T$. Thus, the regret scales linearly with the number of subsystems. We present numerical experiments to illustrate the salient features of the proposed algorithm.\n\n\nIndex Terms-Linear quadratic systems, networked control systems, reinforcement learning, Thompson sampling.\n\n## I. INTRODUCTION\n\nLarge-scale systems comprising of multiple subsystems connected over a network arise in a number of applications including power systems, traffic networks, communication networks and some economic systems [1]. A common feature of such systems is the coupling in their subsystems' dynamics and costs, i.e., the state evolution and local costs of one subsystem depend not only on its own state and control action but also on the states and control actions of other subsystems in the network. Analyzing various aspects of the behavior of such systems and designing control strategies for them under a variety of settings have been long-standing problems of interest in the systems and control literature [2]-[7]. However, there are still many unsolved challenges, especially on the interface between learning and control in the context of these large-scale systems.\n\nIn this paper, we investigate the problem of designing control strategies for large-scale network-coupled subsystems when some parameters of the system model are not known. Due to\n\n[^0]the unknown parameters, the control problem is also a learning problem. We adopt a reinforcement learning framework for this problem with the goal of minimizing and quantifying the regret (i.e. loss in performance) of our learning-and-control strategy with respect to the optimal control strategy based on the complete knowledge of the system model.\n\nThe networked system we consider follows linear dynamics with quadratic costs and Gaussian noise. Such linear-quadraticGaussian (LQG) systems are one of the most commonly used modeling framework in numerous control applications. Part of the appeal of LQG models is the simple structure of the optimal control strategy when the system model is completely known-the optimal control action in this case is a linear or affine function of the state-which makes the optimal strategy easy to identify and easy to implement. If some parameters of the model are not fully known during the design phase or may change during operation, then it is better to design a strategy that learns and adapts online. Historically, both adaptive control [8] and reinforcement learning [9], [10] have been used to design asymptotically optimal learning algorithms for such LQG systems. In recent years, there has been considerable interest in analyzing the transient behavior of such algorithms which can be quantified in terms of the regret of the algorithm as a function of time. This allows one to assess, as a function of time, the performance of a learning algorithm compared to an oracle who knows the system parameters upfront.\n\nSeveral learning algorithms have been proposed for LQG systems [11]-[23], and in most cases the regret is shown to be bounded by $\\mathcal{O}\\left(d_{x}^{0.5}\\left(d_{x}+d_{u}\\right) \\sqrt{T}\\right)$, where $d_{x}$ is the dimension of the state, $d_{u}$ is the dimension of the controls, $T$ is the time horizon, and the $\\mathcal{O}(\\cdot)$ notation hides logarithmic terms in $T$. Given the lower bound of $\\hat{\\Omega}\\left(d_{x}^{0.5} d_{u} \\sqrt{T}\\right)$ (where $\\hat{\\Omega}(\\cdot)$ notation hides logarithmic terms in $T$ ) for regret in LQG systems identified in a recent work [19], the regrets of the existing algorithms have near optimal scaling in terms of time and dimension. However, when directly applied to a networked system with $n$ subsystems, these algorithms would incur $\\mathcal{O}\\left(n^{1.5} d_{x}^{0.5}\\left(d_{x}+d_{u}\\right) \\sqrt{T}\\right)$ regret because the effective dimension of the state and the controls is $n d_{x}$ and $n d_{u}$, where $d_{x}$ and $d_{u}$ are the dimensions of each subsystem. This superlinear dependence on $n$ is prohibitive in large-scale networked systems because the regret per subsystem (which is $\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{n})$ ) grows with the number of subsystems.\n\nThe learning algorithms mentioned above are for a general LQG system and do not take into account any knowledge of the underlying network structure.

      "markdown": "show that by exploiting the structure of the network model, it is possible to design learning algorithms for large-scale networkcoupled subsystems where the regret does not grow superlinearly in the number of subsystems. In particular, we utilize a spectral decomposition technique, recently proposed in [24], to decompose the large-scale system into $L$ decoupled systems, where $L$ is the rank of the coupling matrix corresponding to the underlying network. Using the decoupled systems, we propose a Thompson sampling based algorithm with $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}\\left(n\\right.$ $\\left.d_{x}^{0.5}\\left(d_{x}+d_{n}\\right) \\sqrt{T}\\right)$ regret bound.\na) Related work: Broadly speaking, three classes of lowregret learning algorithms have been proposed for LQG systems: certainty equivalence (CE) based algorithms, optimism in the face of uncertainty (OFU) based algorithms, and Thompson sampling (TS) based algorithms. CE is a classical adaptive control algorithm [8]. Recent papers [16]-[20] have established near optimal high probability bounds on regret for CE-based algorithms. OFU-based algorithms are inspired by the OFU principle for multi-armed bandits [25]. Starting with the work of [11], [12], most of the papers following the OFU approach [13]-[15] also provide similar high probability regret bounds. TS-based algorithms are inspired by TS algorithm for multi-armed bandits [26]. Most papers following this approach [20]-[23] establish bounds on expected Bayesian regret of similar near-optimal orders. As argued earlier, most of these papers show that the regret scales super-linearly with the number of subsystems and are, therefore, of limited value for large-scale systems.\n\nThere is an emerging literature on learning algorithms for networked systems both for LQG models [27]-[29] and MDP models [30]-[33]. The papers on LQG models propose distributed value- or policy-based learning algorithms and analyze their convergence properties, but they do not characterize their regret. Some of the papers on MDP models [32], [33] do characterize regret bounds for OFU and TS-based learning algorithms but these bounds are not directly applicable to the LQG model considered in this paper.\n\nAn important special class of network-coupled systems is mean-field coupled subsystems [34], [35]. There has been considerable interest in reinforcement learning for mean-field models [36]-[38], but most of the literature does not consider regret. The basic mean-field coupled model can be viewed as a special case of the network-coupled subsystems considered in this paper (see Sec. VI-A). In a preliminary version of this paper [39], we proposed a TS-based algorithm for mean-field coupled subsystems which has a $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}((1+1 / n) \\sqrt{T})$ regret per subsystem. The current paper extends the TS-based algorithm to general network-coupled subsystems and establishes scalable regret bounds for arbitrarily coupled networks.\nb) Organization: The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we introduce the model of networkcoupled subsystems. In Section III, we summarize the spectral decomposition idea and the resulting scalable method for synthesizing optimal control strategy when the model parameters are known. Then, in Section IV, we consider the learning problem for unknown network-coupled subsystems and present a TS-based learning algorithm with scalable regret bound. We subsequently provide regret analysis in Section V and numerical\nexperiments in Section VI. We conclude in Section VII.\nc) Notation: The notation $A=\\left[a^{i j}\\right]$ means that $a^{i j}$ is the $(i, j)$ th element of the matrix $A$. For a matrix $A, A^{\\boldsymbol{\\top}}$ denotes its transpose. Given matrices (or vectors) $A_{1}, \\ldots, A_{n}$ with the same number of rows, $\\left[A_{1}, \\ldots, A_{n}\\right]$ denotes the matrix formed by horizontal concatenation. For a random vector $v, \\operatorname{var}(v)$ denotes its covariance matrix. The notation $\\mathcal{N}(\\mu, \\Sigma)$ denotes the multivariate Gaussian distribution with mean vector $\\mu$ and covariance matrix $\\Sigma$.\n\nFor stabilizable $(A, B)$ and positive definite matrices $Q, R$, $\\operatorname{DARE}(A, B, Q, R)$ denotes the unique positive semidefinite solution of the discrete time algebraic Riccati equation (DARE), which is given as\n\n$$\nS=A^{\\top} S A-\\left(A^{\\top} S B\\right)\\left(R+B^{\\top} S B\\right)^{-1}\\left(B^{\\top} S A\\right)+Q\n$$\n\n## II. MODEL OF NETWORK-COUPlEd SUBSYSTEMS\n\nWe start by describing a minor variation of a model of network-coupled subsystems proposed in [24]. The model in [24] was described in continuous time. We translate the model and the results to discrete time.\n\n## A. System model\n\n1) Graph stucture: Consider a network consisting of $n$ subsystems/agents connected over an undirected weighted graph denoted by $\\mathcal{G}\\left(N, E, W_{\\mathcal{G}}\\right)$, where $N=\\{1, \\ldots, n\\}$ is the set of nodes, $E \\subseteq N \\times N$ is the set of edges, and $W_{\\mathcal{G}}=\\left[w^{i j}\\right] \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times n}$ is the weighted adjacency matrix. Let $M=\\left[m^{i j}\\right] \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times n}$ be a symmetric coupling matrix corresponding to the underlying graph $\\mathcal{G}$. For instance, $M$ may represent the underlying adjacency matrix (i.e., $M=W_{\\mathcal{G}}$ ) or the underlying Laplacian matrix (i.e., $M=\\operatorname{diag}\\left(W_{\\mathcal{G}} \\mathbb{1}_{n}\\right)-$ $W_{\\mathcal{G}}$ ).\n2) State and dynamics: The states and control actions of agents take values in $\\mathbb{R}^{d_{x}}$ and $\\mathbb{R}^{d_{n}}$, respectively. For agent $i \\in N$, we use $x_{t}^{i} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d_{x}}$ and $u_{t}^{i} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d_{u}}$ to denote its state and control action at time $t$.\n\nThe system starts at a random initial state $x_{1}=\\left(x_{1}^{i}\\right)_{i \\in N}$, whose components are independent across agents. For agent $i$, the initial state $x_{1}^{i} \\sim \\mathcal{N}\\left(0, \\Xi_{1}^{i}\\right)$, and at any time $t \\geq 1$, the state evolves according to\n\n$$\nx_{t+1}^{i}=A x_{t}^{i}+B u_{t}^{i}+D x_{t}^{\\mathcal{G}, i}+E u_{t}^{\\mathcal{G}, i}+w_{t}^{i}\n$$\n\nwhere $x_{t}^{\\mathcal{G}, i}$ and $u_{t}^{\\mathcal{G}, i}$ are the locally perceived influence of the network on the state of agent $i$ and are given by\n\n$$\nx_{t}^{\\mathcal{G}, i}=\\sum_{j \\in N} m^{i j} x_{t}^{j} \\quad \\text { and } \\quad u_{t}^{\\mathcal{G}, i}=\\sum_{j \\in N} m^{i j} u_{t}^{j}\n$$\n\n$A, B, D, E$ are matrices of appropriate dimensions, and $\\left\\{w_{t}^{i}\\right\\}_{t \\geq 1}, i \\in N$, are i.i.d. zero-mean Gaussian processes which are independent of each other and the initial state. In particular, $w_{t}^{i} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d_{x}}$ and $w_{t}^{i} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, W)$. We call $x_{t}^{\\mathcal{G}, i}$ and $u_{t}^{\\mathcal{G}, i}$ the network-field of the states and control actions at node $i$ at time $t$.\n\nThus, the next state of agent $i$ depends on its current local state and control action, the current network-field of the states and control actions of the system, and the current local noise."

Let $H_{x}=\\left[h_{x}^{i j}\\right]$ and $H_{u}=\\left[h_{u}^{i j}\\right]$. It is assumed that the weight matrices $H_{x}$ and $H_{u}$ are polynomials of $M$, i.e.,\n\n$$\nH_{x}=\\sum_{k=0}^{K_{x}} q_{k} M^{k} \\quad \\text { and } \\quad H_{u}=\\sum_{k=0}^{K_{u}} r_{k} M^{k}\n$$\n\nwhere $K_{x}$ and $K_{u}$ denote the degrees of the polynomials and $\\left\\{q_{k}\\right\\}_{k=0}^{K_{x}}$ and $\\left\\{r_{k}\\right\\}_{k=0}^{K_{u}}$ are real-valued coefficients.\n\nThe assumption that $H_{x}$ and $H_{u}$ are polynomials of $M$ captures the intuition that the per-step cost respects the graph structure. In the special case when $H_{x}=H_{u}=I$, the per-step cost is decoupled across agents. When $H_{x}=H_{u}=I+M$, the per-step cost captures a cross-coupling between one-hop neighbors. Similarly, when $H_{u}=I+M+M^{2}$, the per-step cost captures a cross-coupling between one- and two-hop neighbors. See [24] for more examples of special cases of the per-step cost defined above.\n\n## B. Assumptions on the model\n\nSince $M$ is real and symmetric, it has real eigenvalues.

Planning solution for network-coupled subsystems\n\nWe now present the main result of [24], which provides a scalable method to synthesize the optimal control policy when the system dynamics are known.\n\nBased on Proposition 1, we can view the overall system as the collection of the following subsystems:\n\n- Eigen-system $(\\ell, i), \\ell \\in\\{1, \\ldots, L\\}$ and $i \\in N$ with state $x_{t}^{\\ell, i}$, controls $u_{t}^{\\ell, i}$, dynamics (14), and per-step cost $q^{\\ell} c^{\\ell}\\left(x^{\\ell, i}, u^{\\ell, i}\\right)$.\n- Auxiliary system $i, i \\in N$, with state $\\bar{x}_{t}^{i}$, controls $\\bar{u}_{t}^{i}$, dynamics (15), and per-step cost $\\bar{q}_{0} \\bar{c}\\left(\\bar{x}_{t}^{i}, \\bar{u}_{t}^{i}\\right)$.\n${ }^{1}$ Recall that (A3) ensures that $q_{0}$ and $\\left\\{q^{\\ell}\\right\\}_{\\ell=1}^{L}$ are strictly positive.\n\nLet $\\left(\\theta^{\\ell}\\right)^{\\top}=\\left[A^{\\ell}, B^{\\ell}\\right]:=\\left[\\left(A+\\lambda^{\\ell} D\\right),\\left(B+\\lambda^{\\ell} E\\right)\\right], \\ell \\in$ $\\{1, \\ldots, L\\}$, and $\\bar{\\theta}^{\\top}=[A, B]$ denote the parameters of the dynamics of the eigen and auxiliary systems, respectively. Then, for any policy $\\pi=\\left(\\pi_{1}, \\pi_{2}, \\ldots\\right)$, the performance of the eigensystem $(\\ell, i), \\ell \\in\\{1, \\ldots, L\\}$ and $i \\in N$, is given by $q^{\\ell} J^{\\ell, i}\\left(\\pi ; \\theta^{\\ell}\\right)$, where\n\n$$\nJ^{\\ell, i}\\left(\\pi ; \\theta^{\\ell}\\right)=\\limsup _{T \\rightarrow \\infty} \\frac{1}{T} \\mathbb{E}^{\\pi}\\left[\\sum_{t=1}^{T} c\\left(x_{t}^{\\ell, i}, u_{t}^{\\ell, i}\\right)\\right]\n$$\n\nSimilarly, the performance of the auxiliary system $i, i \\in N$, is given by $\\bar{q}_{0} \\bar{J}^{i}(\\pi ; \\bar{\\theta})$, where\n\n$$\n\\bar{J}^{i}(\\pi ; \\bar{\\theta})=\\limsup _{T \\rightarrow \\infty} \\frac{1}{T} \\mathbb{E}^{\\pi}\\left[\\sum_{t=1}^{T} c\\left(\\bar{x}_{t}^{i}, \\bar{u}_{t}^{i}\\right)\\right]\n$$\n\nProposition 1 implies that the overall performance of policy $\\pi$ can be decomposed as\n\n$$\nJ(\\pi ; \\theta)=\\sum_{i \\in N} q_{0} \\bar{J}^{i}(\\pi ; \\bar{\\theta})+\\sum_{i \\in N} \\sum_{\\ell=1}^{L} q^{\\ell} J^{\\ell, i}\\left(\\pi ; \\theta^{\\ell}\\right)\n$$\n\nThe key intuition behind the result of [24] is as follows. By the certainty equivalence principle for LQ systems, we know that (when the system dynamics are known) the optimal control policy of a stochastic LQ system is the same as the optimal control policy of the corresponding deterministic LQ system where the noises $\\left\\{w_{t}^{i}\\right\\}_{t \\geq 1}$ are assumed to be zero. Note that when noises $\\left\\{w_{t}^{i}\\right\\}_{t \\geq 1}$ are zero, then the noises $\\left\\{w_{t}^{\\ell, i}\\right\\}_{t \\geq 1}$ and $\\left\\{\\bar{w}_{t}^{i}\\right\\}_{t \\geq 1}$ of the eigen- and auxiliary-systems are also zero. This, in turn, implies that the dynamics of all the eigen- and auxiliary systems are decoupled. These decoupled dynamics along with the cost decoupling in (17) imply that we can choose the controls $\\left\\{u_{t}^{\\ell, i}\\right\\}_{t \\geq 1}$ for the eigensystem $(\\ell, i), \\ell \\in$ $\\{1, \\ldots, L\\}$ and $i \\in N$, to minimize ${ }^{2} J^{\\ell, i}\\left(\\pi ; \\theta^{\\ell}\\right)$ and choose the controls $\\left\\{\\bar{u}_{t}^{i}\\right\\}_{t \\geq 1}$ for the auxiliary system $i, i \\in N$, to $\\operatorname{minimize}^{3} \\bar{J}^{i}(\\pi ; \\bar{\\theta})$. These optimization problems are standard optimal control problems. Therefore, similar to [24, Thoerem 3], we obtain the following result.\nTheorem 1 Let $\\bar{S}$ and $\\left\\{S^{\\ell}\\right\\}_{\\ell=1}^{L}$ be the solution of the following discrete time algebraic Riccati equations (DARE):\n\n$$\n\\bar{S}(\\bar{\\theta})=\\operatorname{DARE}\\left(A, B, Q, \\frac{r_{0}}{q_{0}} R\\right)\n$$\n\nand for $\\ell \\in\\{1, \\ldots, L\\}$,\n\n$$\nS^{\\ell}\\left(\\theta^{\\ell}\\right)=\\operatorname{DARE}\\left(A^{\\ell}, B^{\\ell}, Q, \\frac{r_{0}^{\\ell}}{q^{\\ell}} R\\right)\n$$\n\nDefine the gains:\n\n$$\n\\bar{G}(\\bar{\\theta})=-\\left((B)^{\\top} \\bar{S}(\\bar{\\theta}) B+\\frac{r_{0}}{q_{0}} R\\right)^{-1}(B)^{\\top} \\bar{S}(\\bar{\\theta}) A\n$$\n\nand for $\\ell \\in\\{1, \\ldots, L\\}$,\n\n$$\nG^{\\ell}\\left(\\theta^{\\ell}\\right)=-\\left(\\left(B^{\\ell}\\right)^{\\top} S^{\\ell}\\left(\\theta^{\\ell}\\right) B^{\\ell}+\\frac{r^{\\ell}}{q^{\\ell}} R\\right)^{-1}\\left(B^{\\ell}\\right)^{\\top} S^{\\ell}\\left(\\theta^{\\ell}\\right) A^{\\ell}\n$$\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{2}$ The cost of the eigensystem $(\\ell, i)$ is $q^{\\ell} J^{\\ell, i}\\left(\\pi ; \\theta^{\\ell}\\right)$.

Let $\\tilde{\\theta}^{k}$ denote the $k$-th column of $\\tilde{\\theta}$. Thus $\\tilde{\\theta}=\\left[\\tilde{\\theta}^{1}, \\ldots, \\tilde{\\theta}^{d_{e}}\\right]$. Similarly, let $\\theta^{\\ell, k}$ denote the $k$-th column of $\\theta^{\\ell}$. Thus, $\\theta^{\\ell}=\\left[\\theta^{\\ell, 1}, \\ldots, \\theta^{\\ell, d_{e}}\\right]$. We use $p\\left.\\right|_{\\Theta}$ to denote the restriction of probability distribution $p$ on the set $\\Theta$.\n\nWe assume that $\\tilde{\\theta}$ and $\\left\\{\\theta^{\\ell}\\right\\}_{\\ell=1}^{L}$ are random variables that are independent of the initial states and the noise processes. Furthermore, we assume that the priors $\\bar{p}_{1}$ and $\\left\\{p_{1}^{\\ell}\\right\\}_{\\ell=1}^{L}$ on $\\tilde{\\theta}$ and $\\left\\{\\theta^{\\ell}\\right\\}_{\\ell=1}^{L}$, respectively, satisfy the following:\n(A6) $\\bar{p}_{1}$ is given as:\n\n$$\n\\bar{p}_{1}(\\tilde{\\theta})=\\left.\\left[\\prod_{k=1}^{d_{e}} \\bar{\\xi}_{1}^{k}\\left(\\tilde{\\theta}^{k}\\right)\\right]\\right|_{\\tilde{\\Theta}}\n$$\n\nwhere for $k \\in\\left\\{1, \\ldots, d_{x}\\right\\}, \\bar{\\xi}_{1}^{k}=\\mathcal{N}\\left(\\bar{\\mu}_{1}^{k}, \\bar{\\Sigma}_{1}\\right)$ with mean $\\bar{\\mu}_{1}^{k} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d_{e}+d_{u}}$ and positive-definite covariance $\\bar{\\Sigma}_{1} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{\\left(d_{e}+d_{u}\\right) \\times\\left(d_{e}+d_{u}\\right)}$.\n(A7) For each $\\ell \\in\\{1, \\ldots, L\\}$, $p_{1}^{\\ell}$ is given as:\n\n$$\np_{1}^{\\ell}\\left(\\theta^{\\ell}\\right)=\\left.\\left[\\prod_{k=1}^{d_{e}} \\xi_{1}^{\\ell, k}\\left(\\theta^{\\ell, k}\\right)\\right]\\right|_{\\Theta^{\\ell}}\n$$\n\nwhere for $k \\in\\left\\{1, \\ldots, d_{x}\\right\\}, \\xi_{1}^{\\ell, k}=\\mathcal{N}\\left(\\mu_{1}^{\\ell, k}, \\Sigma_{1}^{\\ell}\\right)$ with mean $\\mu_{1}^{\\ell, k} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{\\left(d_{e}+d_{u}\\right)}$ and positive-definite covariance $\\Sigma_{1}^{l} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{\\left(d_{e}+d_{u}\\right) \\times\\left(d_{e}+d_{u}\\right)}$.\nThese assumptions are similar to the assumptions on the prior in the recent literature on Thompson sampling for LQ systems [21], [22].\nOur learning algorithm (and TS-based algorithms in general) keeps track of a posterior distribution on the unknown parameters based on observed data. Motivated by the nature of the planning solution (see Theorem 1), we maintain separate posterior distributions on $\\tilde{\\theta}$ and $\\left\\{\\theta^{\\ell}\\right\\}_{\\ell=1}^{L}$. For each $\\ell$, we select an subsystem $i_{s}^{\\ell}$ such that the $i_{s}^{\\ell}$-th component of the eigenvector $v^{\\ell}$ is non-zero (i.e. $v^{\\ell, i_{s}^{\\ell}} \\neq 0$ ). At time $t$, we maintain a posterior distribution $p_{t}^{\\ell}$ on $\\theta^{\\ell}$ based on the corresponding eigen state and action history of the $i_{s}^{\\ell}$-th subsystem. In other words, for any Borel subset $B$ of $\\mathbb{R}^{\\left(d_{e}+d_{u}\\right) \\times d_{e}}, p_{t}^{\\ell}(B)$ gives the following conditional probability\n\n$$\np_{t}^{\\ell}(B)=\\mathbb{P}\\left(\\theta^{\\ell} \\in B \\mid x_{1: t}^{\\ell, i_{s}^{\\ell}}, u_{1: t-1}^{\\ell, i_{s}^{\\ell}}\\right)\n$$\n\nWe maintain a separate posterior distribution $\\bar{p}_{t}$ on $\\tilde{\\theta}$ as follows.

Therefore, the result follows from standard results in Gaussian linear regression [40].\n\n## C. The Thompson sampling algorithm:\n\nWe propose a Thompson sampling based algorithm called Net-TSDE which is inspired by the TSDE (Thompson sampling with dynamic episodes) algorithm proposed in [21], [22] and the structure of the optimal planning solution described in Sec. III-B. The Thompson sampling part of our algorithm is modeled after the modification of TSDE presented in [41].\nThe Net-TSDE algorithm consists of a coordinator $\\mathcal{C}$ and $|L|+1$ actors: an auxiliary actor $\\overline{\\mathcal{A}}$ and an eigen actor $\\mathcal{A}^{\\ell}$ for each $\\ell \\in\\{1,2, \\ldots, L\\}$. These actors are described below and the whole algorithm is presented in Algorithm 1.\n\n- At each time, the coordinator $\\mathcal{C}$ observes the current global state $x_{t}$, computes the eigenstates $\\left\\{x_{t}^{\\ell}\\right\\}_{t=1}^{L}$ and the auxiliary states $\\bar{x}_{t}$, and sends the eigenstate $x_{t}^{\\ell}$ to the eigen actor $\\mathcal{A}^{\\ell}, \\ell \\in\\{1, \\ldots, L\\}$, and sends the auxiliary state $\\bar{x}_{t}$ to the auxiliary actor $\\overline{\\mathcal{A}}$. The eigen actor $\\mathcal{A}^{\\ell}, \\ell \\in\\{1, \\ldots, L\\}$, computes the eigencontrol $u_{t}^{\\ell}$ and the auxiliary actor $\\overline{\\mathcal{A}}$ computes the auxiliary control $\\bar{u}_{t}$ (as per the details presented below) and both send their computed controls back to the coordinator $\\mathcal{C}$. The coordinator then computes and executes the control action $u_{t}^{i}=\\sum_{\\ell=1}^{L} u_{t}^{\\ell, i}+\\bar{u}_{t}^{i}$ for each subsystem $i \\in N$.\n- The eigen actor $\\mathcal{A}^{\\ell}, \\ell \\in\\{1, \\ldots, L\\}$, maintains the posterior $p_{t}^{\\ell}$ on $\\theta^{\\ell}$ according to (28). The actor works in episodes of dynamic length. Let $t_{k}^{\\ell}$ and $T_{k}^{\\ell}$ denote the starting time and the length of episode $k$, respectively. Each episode is of a minimum length $T_{\\min }^{\\ell}+1$, where $T_{\\min }^{\\ell}$ is chosen as described in [41]. Episode $k$ ends if the determinant of covariance $\\Sigma_{t}^{\\ell}$ falls below half of its value at time $t_{k}^{\\ell}$ (i.e., $\\operatorname{det}\\left(\\Sigma_{t}^{\\ell}\\right)<\\frac{1}{2} \\operatorname{det} \\Sigma_{t_{k}^{\\ell}}$ ) or if the length of the episode is one more than the length of the previous episode (i.e., $t-t_{k}^{\\ell}>T_{k-1}^{\\ell}$ ). Thus,\n\n$$\nt_{k+1}^{\\ell}=\\min \\left\\{t>t_{k}^{\\ell}+T_{\\min }^{\\ell} \\left\\lvert\\, \\begin{array}{l}\nt-t_{k}^{\\ell}>T_{k-1}^{\\ell} \\text { or } \\\\\n\\operatorname{det} \\Sigma_{t}^{\\ell}<\\frac{1}{2} \\operatorname{det} \\Sigma_{t_{k}^{\\ell}}\n\\end{array}\\right.\\right\\}\n$$\n\nAt the beginning of episode $k$, the eigen actor $\\mathcal{A}^{\\ell}$ samples a parameter $\\theta_{k}^{\\ell}$ according to the posterior distribution $p_{t_{k}^{\\ell}}^{\\ell}$. During episode $k$, the eigen actor $\\mathcal{A}^{\\ell}$ generates the eigen controls using the sampled parameter $\\theta_{k}^{\\ell}$, i.e., $u_{t}^{\\ell}=$ $G^{\\ell}\\left(\\theta_{k}^{\\ell}\\right) x_{t}^{\\ell}$.\n\n- The auxiliary actor $\\overline{\\mathcal{A}}$ is similar to the eigen actor. Actor $\\overline{\\mathcal{A}}$ maintains the posterior $\\bar{p}_{t}$ on $\\bar{\\theta}$ according to (29). The actor works in episodes of dynamic length. The episodes of the auxiliary actor $\\overline{\\mathcal{A}}$ and the eigen actors $\\mathcal{A}^{\\ell}, \\ell \\in\\{1,2, \\ldots, L\\}$, are separate from each other. ${ }^{4}$ Let $\\bar{t}_{k}$ and $\\bar{T}_{k}$ denote the starting time and the length of episode $k$, respectively.

In other words, the assumption holds when the true system is in a small neighborhood of a known nominal system. Such a the small neighborhood can be learned with high probability by running appropriate stabilizing procedures for finite time [19], [42].\nThe following result provides an upper bound on the regret of the proposed algorithm.\nTheorem 2 Under (A1)-(A8), the regret of Net-TSDE is upper bounded as follows:\n\n$$\nR(T ; \\text { Net-TSDE }) \\leq \\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}\\left(\\alpha^{\\mathcal{G}} \\sigma_{w}^{2} d_{x}^{0.5}\\left(d_{x}+d_{u}\\right) \\sqrt{T}\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere $\\alpha^{\\mathcal{G}}=\\sum_{\\ell=1}^{L} q^{\\ell}+q_{0}(n-L)$.\nSee Section V for proof.\nRemark 1 The term $\\alpha^{\\mathcal{G}}$ in the regret bound partially captures the impact of the network on the regret. The coefficients $r_{0}$ and $\\left\\{r^{\\ell}\\right\\}_{\\ell=1}^{L}$ depend on the network and also affect the regret but their dependence is hidden inside the $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(\\cdot)$ notation. It is possible to explicitly characterize this dependence but doing so does not provide any additional insights. We discuss the impact of the network coupling on the regret in Section VI via some examples.\nRemark 2 The regret per subsystem is given by $R(T ;$ Net-TSDE $) / n$, which is proportional to\n\n$$\n\\alpha^{\\mathcal{G}} / n=\\mathcal{O}\\left(\\frac{L}{n}\\right)+\\mathcal{O}\\left(\\frac{n-1}{n}\\right)=\\mathcal{O}\\left(1+\\frac{L}{n}\\right)\n$$\n\nThus, the regret per-subsystem scales as $\\mathcal{O}(1+L / n)$.

This clearly illustrates the benefit of the proposed learning algorithm.\n\n## V. REGRET ANALYSIS\n\nFor the ease of notation, we simply use $R(T)$ instead of $R(T ;$ Net-TSDE $)$ in this section.

III-B, $\\bar{q}_{0} \\bar{R}^{i}(T), i \\in N$, is the regret associated with auxiliary system $i$ and $q^{\\ell} R^{\\ell, i}(T), \\ell \\in\\{1, \\ldots, L\\}$ and $i \\in N$, is the regret associated with eigensystem $(\\ell, i)$. We now bound $\\bar{R}^{i}(T)$ and $R^{\\ell, i}(T)$ separately.\n\n## A. Bound on $R^{\\ell, i}(T)$\n\nFix $\\ell \\in\\{1, \\ldots, L\\}$. For the component $i_{*}^{\\ell}$, the Net-TSDE algorithm is exactly same as the variation of the TSDE algorithm of [22] presented in [41]. Therefore, from [41, Theorem 1], it follows that\n\n$$\nR^{\\ell, i_{*}^{\\ell}}(T) \\leq \\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}\\left(\\left(\\sigma^{\\ell, i_{*}^{\\ell}}\\right)^{2} d_{x}^{0.5}\\left(d_{x}+d_{u}\\right) \\sqrt{T}\\right)\\right)\n$$\n\nWe now show that the regret of other eigensystems $(\\ell, i)$ with $i \\neq i_{*}^{\\ell}$ also satisfies a similar bound.\nLemma 2 The regret of eigensystem $(\\ell, i), \\ell \\in\\{1, \\ldots, L\\}$ and $i \\in N$, is bounded as follows:\n\n$$\nR^{\\ell, i}(T) \\leq \\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}\\left(\\left(\\sigma^{\\ell, i}\\right)^{2} d_{x}^{0.5}\\left(d_{x}+d_{u}\\right) \\sqrt{T}\\right)\n$$\n\nProof Fix $\\ell \\in\\{1, \\ldots, L\\}$. Recall from (10) that $x_{t}^{\\ell}=$ $x_{t} v^{\\ell}\\left(v^{\\ell}\\right)^{\\top}$. Therefore, for any $i \\in N$,\n\n$$\nx_{t}^{\\ell, i}=x_{t} v^{\\ell} v^{\\ell, i}=v^{\\ell, i} x_{t} v^{\\ell}\n$$\n\nwhere the last equality follows because $v^{\\ell, i}$ is a scalar. Since we are using the same gain $G^{\\ell}\\left(\\theta_{k}^{\\ell}\\right)$ for all agents $i \\in N$, we have\n\n$$\nu_{t}^{\\ell, i}=G^{\\ell}\\left(\\theta_{k}^{\\ell}\\right) x_{t}^{\\ell, i}=v^{\\ell, i} G^{\\ell}\\left(\\theta_{k}^{\\ell}\\right) x_{t} v^{\\ell}\n$$\n\nThus, we can write (recall that $i_{*}^{\\ell}$ is chosen such that $v^{\\ell, i_{*}^{\\ell}} \\neq 0$ ),\n\n$$\nx_{t}^{\\ell, i}=\\left(\\frac{v^{\\ell, i}}{v^{\\ell, i_{*}^{\\ell}}}\\right) x_{t}^{\\ell, i_{*}^{\\ell}} \\text { and } u_{t}^{\\ell, i}=\\left(\\frac{v^{\\ell, i}}{v^{\\ell, i_{*}^{\\ell}}}\\right) u_{t}^{\\ell, i_{*}^{\\ell}}, \\quad \\forall i \\in N\n$$\n\nThus, for any $i \\in N$,\n\n$$\nc^{\\ell}\\left(x_{t}^{\\ell, i}, u_{t}^{\\ell, i}\\right)=\\left(\\frac{v^{\\ell, i}}{v^{\\ell, i_{*}^{\\ell}}}\\right)^{2} c^{\\ell}\\left(x_{t}^{\\ell, i_{*}^{\\ell}}, u_{t}^{\\ell, i_{*}^{\\ell}}\\right)\n$$\n\nMoreover, from (23), we have\n\n$$\nJ^{\\ell, i}\\left(\\theta^{\\ell}\\right)=\\left(\\frac{v^{\\ell, i}}{v^{\\ell, i_{*}^{\\ell}}}\\right)^{2} J^{\\ell, i_{*}^{\\ell}}\\left(\\theta^{\\ell}\\right)\n$$\n\nBy combining (33) and (34), we get\n\n$$\nR^{\\ell, i}(T)=\\left(\\frac{v^{\\ell, i}}{v^{\\ell, i_{*}^{\\ell}}}\\right)^{2} R^{\\ell, i_{*}^{\\ell}}(T)\n$$\n\nSubstituting the bound for $R^{\\ell, i_{*}^{\\ell}}(T)$ from (31) and observing that $\\left(v^{\\ell, i} / v^{\\ell, i_{*}^{\\ell}}\\right)^{2}=\\left(\\sigma^{\\ell, i} / \\sigma^{\\ell, i_{*}^{\\ell}}\\right)^{2}$ gives the result."

Eq. (38) establishes the result of Theorem 2.\n\n## VI. Some examples\n\n## A. Mean-field system\n\nConsider a complete graph $\\mathcal{G}$ where the edge weights are equal to $1 / n$. Let $M$ be equal to the adjacency matrix of the graph, i.e., $M=\\frac{1}{n} \\mathbb{1}_{n \\times n}$. Thus, the system dynamics are given by\n\n$$\nx_{t+1}^{i}=A x_{t}^{i}+B u_{t}^{i}+D \\breve{x}_{t}+E \\breve{u}_{t}+w_{t}^{i}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\breve{x}_{t}=\\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i \\in N} x_{t}^{i}$ and $\\breve{u}_{t}=\\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i \\in N} u_{t}^{i}$. Suppose $K_{x}=$ $K_{u}=1$ and $q_{0}=r_{0}=1 / n$ and $q_{1}=r_{1}=\\kappa / n$, where $\\kappa$ is a positive constant.\n\nIn this case, $M$ has rank $L=1$, the non-zero eigenvalue of $M$ is $\\lambda^{1}=1$, the corresponding normalized eigenvector is $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}} \\mathbb{1}_{n \\times 1}$ and $q^{1}=r^{1}=q_{0}+q_{1}=(1+\\kappa) / n$. The eigenstate is given by $x_{t}^{i}=\\left[\\breve{x}_{t}, \\ldots, \\breve{x}_{t}\\right]$ and a similar structure holds for the eigencontrol $u_{t}^{i}$. The per-step cost can be written as (see Proposition 1)\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& c\\left(x_{t}, u_{t}\\right)=(1+\\kappa)\\left[\\breve{x}_{t}^{\\top} Q \\breve{x}_{t}+\\breve{u}_{t}^{\\top} R \\breve{u}_{t}\\right] \\\\\n& \\quad+\\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i \\in N}\\left[\\left(x_{t}^{i}-\\breve{x}_{t}\\right)^{\\top} Q\\left(x_{t}^{i}-\\breve{x}_{t}\\right)+\\left(u_{t}^{i}-\\breve{u}_{t}\\right)^{\\top} R\\left(u_{t}^{i}-\\breve{u}_{t}\\right)\\right]\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThus, the system is similar to the mean-field team system investigated in [6], [7].\nFor this model, the network dependent constant $\\alpha^{\\mathcal{G}}$ in the regret bound of Theorem 2 is given by $\\alpha^{\\mathcal{G}}=\\left(1+\\frac{\\kappa}{n}\\right)=$ $\\mathcal{O}\\left(1+\\frac{1}{n}\\right)$. Thus, for the mean-field system, the regret of Net-TSDE scales as $\\mathcal{O}\\left(1+\\frac{1}{n}\\right)$ with the number of agents. This is consistent with the discussion following Theorem 2.\n\nWe test these conclusions via numerical simulations of a scalar mean-field model with $d_{x}=d_{u}=1, \\sigma_{w}^{2}=1, A=1$, $B=0.3, D=0.5, E=0.2, Q=1, R=1$, and $\\kappa=0.5$. The uncertain sets are chosen as $\\Theta^{1}=\\left\\{\\theta^{1} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2}: A+D+\\right.$ $\\left.(B+E) G^{1}\\left(\\theta^{1}\\right)<\\delta\\right\\}$ and $\\breve{\\Theta}=\\left\\{\\breve{\\theta} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2}: A+B \\breve{G}(\\breve{\\theta})<\\right.$ $\\delta\\}$ where $\\delta=0.99$. The prior over these uncertain sets is chosen according to (A6)-(A7) where $\\breve{\\mu}_{1}=\\mu_{1}^{1}=[1,1]^{\\top}$ and $\\breve{\\Sigma}_{1}=\\Sigma_{1}^{1}=I$. We set $T_{\\min }=0$ in Net-TSDE. The system is simulated for a horizon of $T=5000$ and the expected regret $R(T)$ averaged over 500 sample trajectories is shown in Fig. 1. As expected, the regret scales as $\\breve{\\mathcal{O}}(\\sqrt{T})$ with time and $\\mathcal{O}\\left(1+\\frac{1}{n}\\right)$ with the number of agents."

A general low-rank network\n\nWe consider a network with $4 n$ nodes given by the graph $\\mathcal{G}=\\mathcal{G}^{\\circ} \\otimes \\mathcal{C}_{n}$, where $\\mathcal{G}^{\\circ}$ is a 4 -node graph shown in Fig. 2 and $\\mathcal{C}_{n}$ is the complete graph with $n$ nodes and each edge weight equal to $\\frac{1}{n}$. Let $M$ be the adjacency matrix of $\\mathcal{G}$ which is given as $M=M^{\\circ} \\otimes \\frac{1}{n} \\mathbb{1}_{n \\times n}$, where $M^{\\circ}$ is the adjacency matrix of $\\mathcal{G}^{\\circ}$ shown in Fig. 2. Moreover, suppose $K_{x}=2$ with $q_{0}=1, q_{1}=-2$, and $q_{2}=1$ and $K_{u}=0$ with $r_{0}=1$. Note that the cost is not normalized per-agent.\n\nIn this case, the rank of $M^{\\circ}$ is 2 with eigenvalues $\\pm \\rho$, where $\\rho=\\sqrt{2\\left(a^{2}+b^{2}\\right)}$ and the rank of $\\frac{1}{n} \\mathbb{1}_{n \\times n}$ is 1 with eigenvalue 1. Thus, $M=M^{\\circ} \\otimes \\frac{1}{n} \\mathbb{1}_{n \\times n}$ has the same non-zero eigenvalues as $M^{\\circ}$ given by $\\lambda^{1}=\\rho$ and $\\lambda^{2}=-\\rho$. Further, $q^{\\ell}=\\left(1-\\lambda^{\\ell}\\right)^{2}$ and $r^{\\ell}=1$, for $\\ell \\in\\{1,2\\}$. We assume that $a^{2}+b^{2} \\neq 0.5$, so that the model satisfies (A3).\n\nFor this model, the scaling parameter $\\alpha^{\\mathcal{G}}$ in the regret bound in Theorem 2 is given by\n\n$$\n\\alpha^{\\mathcal{G}}=(1-\\rho)^{2}+(1+\\rho)^{2}+(4 n-2)=4 n+2 \\rho^{2}\n$$\n\nRecall that $\\rho^{2}=\\left(\\lambda^{1}\\right)^{2}=\\left(\\lambda^{2}\\right)^{2}$. Thus, $\\alpha^{\\mathcal{G}}$ has an explicit dependence on the square of the eigenvalues and the number of nodes.\n\nWe verify this relationship via numerical simulations. We consider the graph above with two choices of parameters $(a, b)$ : (i) $a=b=0.05$ and (ii) $a=b=5$. For both cases, we consider a scalar system with parameters same as the mean-field system\nconsidered in Sec. VI-A. The regret for both cases with different choices of number of agents $4 n \\in\\{4,40,80,100\\}$ is shown in Fig. 3.

CONCLUSION\n\nWe consider the problem of controlling an unknown LQG system consisting of multiple subsystems connected over a network. By utilizing a spectral decomposition technique, we decompose the coupled subsystems into eigen and auxiliary systems. We propose a TS-based learning algorithm Net-TSDE which maintains separate posterior distributions on the unknown parameters $\\theta^{\\ell}, \\ell \\in\\{1, \\ldots, L\\}$, and $\\hat{\\theta}$ associated with the eigen and auxiliary systems respectively. For each eigen-system, Net-TSDE learns the unknown parameter $\\theta^{\\ell}$ and controls the system in a manner similar to the TSDE algorithm for single agent LQG systems proposed in [21], [22], [41]. Consequently, the regret for each eigen system can be bounded using the results of [21], [22], [41]. However, the part of the Net-TSDE algorithm that performs learning and control for the auxiliary system has an agent selection step and thus requires additional analysis to bound its regret. Combining the regret bounds for the eigen and auxiliary systems shows that the total expected regret of Net-TSDE is upper bounded by $\\mathcal{O}\\left(n d_{x}^{0.5}\\left(d_{x}+d_{u}\\right) \\sqrt{T}\\right)$. The empirically observed scaling of regret with respect to the time horizon $T$ and the number of subsystems $n$ in our numerical experiments agrees with the theoretical upper bound.\n\nThe results presented in this paper rely on the spectral decomposition developed in [24]. A limitation of this decomposition is that the local dynamics (i.e., the $(A, B)$ matrices) are assumed to be identical for all subsystems. Interesting generalizations overcoming this limitation include settings where (i) there are multiple types of subsystems and the $(A, B)$ matrices are the same for subsystems of the same type but different across types; and (ii) the subsystems are not identical but approximately identical, i.e., there are nominal dynamics $\\left(A^{\\circ}, B^{\\circ}\\right)$ and the local dynamics $\\left(A^{i}, B^{i}\\right)$ of subsystem $i$ are in a small neighborhood of $\\left(A^{\\circ}, B^{\\circ}\\right)$.\n\nThe decomposition in [24] exploits the fact that the dynamics and the cost couplings have the same spectrum (i.e., the same orthonormal eigenvectors). It is also possible to consider learning algorithms which exploit other features of the network such as sparsity in the case of networked MDPs [32], [33].\n\n## REFERENCES\n\n[1] N. Sandell, P.
