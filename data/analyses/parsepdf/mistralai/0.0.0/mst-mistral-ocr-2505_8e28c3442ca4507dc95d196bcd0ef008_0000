Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is accompanied by highly individualized neuroanatomical deviations that potentially map onto distinct genotypes and clinical phenotypes. However, the link between biological pathways and differences in brain anatomy, which may pave the way towards targeted therapeutic interventions, remains poorly understood.\n\n\nMethods. Our study examined neurodevelopmental differences in cortical thickness (CT) and their genomic underpinnings in a large and clinically diverse sample of 360 individuals with ASD and 270 typically developing controls (aged 6-30 years) within the EU-AIMS Longitudinal European Autism Project (LEAP). We also examined neurodevelopmental differences and their potential pathophysiological mechanisms between clinical ASD subgroups, which differed in the severity and pattern of sensory features.\n\nResults. In addition to significant between-group differences in 'core' ASD brain regions (i.e. fronto-temporal and cingulate regions), we found that ASD individuals manifested as neuroanatomical outliers within the neurotypical CT range in a wider neural system, which was enriched for genes known to be implicated in ASD on the genetic and/or transcriptomic level. Within these regions, the individuals' total (i.e. accumulated) degree of neuroanatomical atypicality was significantly correlated with the higher polygenic scores for ASD, and other psychiatric conditions, and scaled with measures of symptom severity. Differences in CT deviations were also associated with distinct sensory subgroups, especially in brain regions expressing genes involved in excitatory rather than inhibitory neurotransmission.\n\nConclusions. Our findings corroborate the link between macroscopic differences in brain anatomy and the molecular mechanisms underpinning heterogeneity in ASD, and provide future targets for stratification and subtyping."

      "markdown": "# Introduction \n\nThere is increasing recognition that major psychiatric conditions are highly heterogeneous at both the causative and phenotypic level (1). Assessing this heterogeneity is crucial in allowing more precise inferences about the aetiological mechanisms underpinning these conditions, and to pave the way towards better targeted (i.e. personalized) therapeutic interventions. This particularly applies to Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), which is a common neurodevelopmental condition that is clinically characterized by (i) atypical social communication and interaction, (ii) the presence of rigid, repetitive and stereotyped behaviors, and (iii) atypical sensory processing (2). These core ASD symptoms emerge alongside atypical anatomical development of several neurocognitive systems (3,4). Regional neuroanatomical differences in ASD, however, typically have small effect sizes (5), and reflect highly variable patterns of neurodevelopmental deviations across individuals (6). This makes it inherently difficult to link atypical brain structure to molecular and pathophysiological mechanisms.\n\nFew studies to date have explored the genomic mechanisms underpinning atypical neurodevelopment in ASD. Notably, a recent study by Romero-Garcia et al. (2019) demonstrated that differences in cortical thickness (CT) during childhood are robustly associated with genes involved in synaptic transmission pathways that are known to be downregulated in the post-mortem ASD cortex $(7,8)$. This study represents an important step towards 'closing the gap' between molecular and macroscopic pathology in ASD, and highlights the potential of in vivo neuroimaging markers for patient stratification and subtyping. However, the study only examined a narrow range of individuals across the autism spectrum, i.e. 10-year-olds with an average full-scale IQ (FSIQ). It therefore remains unknown if - and how - these findings generalize to the wider autism phenotype that is highly heterogeneous not only between individuals meeting diagnostic criteria (9), but also within individuals across development (10).\n\nIn the current study, we explored inter-individual differences in CT and their potential molecular underpinnings in a large, clinically diverse sample of ASD individuals and controls within the EU-AIMS Longitudinal European Autism Project (LEAP; www.aims-2-trials.eu) (11). This study provides deep phenotypic assessments and genotypic data of more than 700 individuals, including males and females between 6"

Rather than exclusively focusing on 'core' ASD regions (i.e. regions with a significant between-group difference), we based our investigation on local (i.e. regional) and global (i.e. cortex-level) neuroanatomical deviations from the neurotypical range of CT in our sample. A similar approach has previously been used to assess neuroanatomical heterogeneity in ASD $(6,12)$, and for the biologically-driven stratification of ASD into putative subtypes (13). Here, we used the technique to (i) identify a wider set of brain regions where being a neuroanatomical outlier significantly impacts on the probability (i.e. risk) of ASD in our sample, and (ii) to link patterns of neuroanatomical variability to ASD symptomatology and genetic risk factors.\n\nMore specifically, leveraging the spatial gene expression data of the Allen Human Brain Atlas (AHBA; (14)), we tested the hypothesis that brain regions associated with high neuroanatomical variability in ASD express more than expected genes that (i) are enriched for rare (15) or common ASD risk variants (16), and/or (ii) are abnormally expressed in ASD $(8,17,18)$. Moreover, using a virtual histology approach (19), we probed the potential molecular mechanisms underpinning clinical heterogeneity in ASD via patterns of neurodevelopmental deviations that differed between distinct sensory ASD subgroups (20). We focused on sensory symptoms as these have previously been highlighted as promising candidates in parsing heterogeneity in ASD (21). Moreover, sensory features have aetiologically been linked to an imbalance between excitation and inhibition (E/I) $(22,23)$, which provides a reasonable conceptual framework for hypothesis testing."

A comprehensive description of the sample has been published elsewhere (9). In brief, the total sample for which usable structural MRI data was available included $\\mathrm{N}=360$ ASD individuals and $\\mathrm{N}=279$ controls, split in $\\mathrm{N}=274$ typically developing (TD) participants and $\\mathrm{N}=25$ individuals with mild intellectual disability (ID) (14 males and 15 females defined by FSIQ between 50 and 74), between the ages of 6 and 30 years (Table 1, SF1). A full list of in- and exclusion criteria, clinical assessments, and medication status is provided in the Supplement. An independent ethics committee approved the study. Written informed consent was obtained for all participants.\n\n## MRI Data Acquisition\n\nAll participants were scanned with an MRI scanner operating at 3 T at 6 different sites (University of Cambridge and King's College London, UK: Mannheim University, Germany; Radboud University and Utrecht University, Netherlands; Rome University, Italy). High-resolution structural T1-weighted volumetric images were acquired with full head coverage, at 1.2 mm thickness with $1.2 \\times 1.2 \\mathrm{~mm}$ in-plane resolution (see ST2 for details).\n\n## Cortical Surface Reconstructions using FreeSurfer\n\nUsable structural MRI data was initially available for $\\mathrm{N}=709$ individuals in the LEAP sample. FreeSurfer v6.0.0 software (http://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/) was used to derive models of the cortical surface for each T1-weighted image. These wellvalidated and fully automated procedures have been described extensively elsewhere (24, 25). Each reconstructed surface underwent strict quality assessments (see Supplement), resulting in a final sample of $\\mathrm{N}=639$.

Corrections for multiple comparisons were performed using 'random field theory' (RFT)-based cluster analysis for non-isotropic images with a cluster-based significance threshold ( $p_{\\text {clust }}$ ) $<0.05$ (2-tailed, (27)). Effect sizes associated with each model term were assessed using Cohen's $f$, where a value of $0.1,0.25$, and 0.4 indicates a small, medium, and large effect respectively. At each vertex, we also used a Levene's test to assess between-group differences in CT variability at a False Discovery Rate (FDR)-corrected $p$-value $\\left(p_{\\text {adj }}\\right)<0.05$.

To this aim, we performed a gene expression decoding analysis (GEDA) within Neurosynth and NeuroVault (33) to identify genes whose spatial expression patterns resembles our neuroimaging findings (see Supplement for details). In brief, this analysis utilizes the gene expression data from the Allen Human Brain Atlas (AHBA (14)) to statistically assess the spatial correlation between our neuroimaging maps ( $t$-map, Cohen's $f$-map, $\\mathcal{N}$-outlier maps) and the patterns of expression for each of 20,787 protein coding genes. To do so, the six AHBA donor brains are initially co-registered with the neuroimaging data to bring normalized gene expression values into transcriptomic alignment with the FreeSurfer surface overlays (see SF20). A linear model is then constructed for each donor brain, where the slopes encode the spatial correlation between each gene's expression pattern and the values contained in the statistical maps at each probe (i.e. sampling site). The slopes are then subjected to a one-sample $t$-test to identify genes whose expression patterns are consistently (i.e. across donor brains) highly similar to the imaging maps.\n\nThe resulting gene lists for each statistical map were thresholded at $p<0.01$. We chose this liberal threshold as this analysis did not constitute a hypothesis test per se, but rather a selection step to provide a list of candidate genes. This list was subsequently tested for enrichment with genes previously implicated in ASD in genetic and transcriptomic studies. At the genetic level, this included ASD risk genes with denovo and rare variants (15), and GWAS-significant ASD risk genes with common variants (16). At the level of differential gene expression, we tested gene-lists that are (i) differentially expressed (i.e. upregulated/downregulated) in post-mortem cortical tissue (17), and in specific neuronal cell types in ASD (18), and (ii) genes of differentially expressed co-regulated modules in ASD $(8,34)$. We also included the ASD-gene list compiled by the SFARI database (categories S,1,2,3 downloaded November 2020 from https://gene.sfari.org/).

The subgroups were originally derived by (20) using a factor mixture modelling approach across questionnaire items of the Short Sensory Profile (SSP (37), see ST5 for summary scores), which resulted in three groups of 'sensory low' ( $N=209$ ), 'sensory moderate' ( $N=37$ ), and 'sensory severe' ( $N=18$ ) ASD individuals in our sample. At each vertex, an $F$-test for the main effect of sensory subgroup was performed based on the individuals' standardized CT deviations ( $z_{\\text {res }}$ ) using an RFTcorrected $p$-value $<0.05$. Given the link between atypical sensory processing and E/I imbalance (22), we employed a virtual histology approach to relate regional differences between ASD subgroups to those in cell-specific gene expression (19). To this end, a GEDA of the resulting $F$-map was performed as outlined above. The list of significant decoded genes was subsequently tested for cell-type enrichment based on the Single-Cell Transcriptomic Atlas of Human Neocortical Development during Mid-gestation (38), which - among others - allowed us to test for an enrichment of genes representing different subtypes of excitatory and inhibitory cells."

The number of ASD risk genes with common and de novo variants was, however, small overall, and only included a total of 1,455 SNPs in our sample (see ST4). We therefore also examined the association between genotype and phenotype based on genome-wide PGS. Measures of tAIs were significantly correlated with the genome-wide risk for ASD ( $r=0.11, p_{\\text {adj }}<0.05$ ), ADHD ( $r=0.2, p_{\\text {adj }}<0.01$ ), depression ( $r=0.16, p_{\\text {adj }}<0.01$ ), schizophrenia ( $r=0.11, p_{\\text {adj }}<0.05$ ), and neuroticism ( $r=0.16, p_{\\text {adj }}<0.01$ ) (Figure 3f).

Here, ASD individuals in the 'moderate' and sensory 'severe' subgroups displayed a significantly larger proportion of negative CT deviations compared to 'sensory low' individuals ( $\\mathcal{P}(2)=10.131, p<0.01$ ) (Figure 4c). Neuroanatomical deviations in this region were also significantly correlated with the 'movement sensitivity' subdomain of the $\\operatorname{SSP}(r=-0.186, p_{\\text {adj }}<0.01)$, which was the subdomain that differed the most between subgroups (Effect Size=2.52) (20) (Figure 4d).

In addition to these 'core' ASD brain areas, we identified a wider spatially distributed network of regions where ASD individuals, and ID controls, manifested as neuroanatomical outliers. This network of regions was enriched for genes known to be upregulated in ASD during childhood and adolescence. Moreover, within this network, the individuals' total degree of neuroanatomical abnormality was significantly correlated with measures of symptom severity, as well as with the polygenic risk for ASD and other psychiatric conditions. Last, we demonstrate that distinct clinical ASD subgroups display different patterns of neurodevelopmental deviations, which map onto specific cell types in the developing cortex. Our study thus provides novel insights into the genetic and neurobiological mechanisms underpinning heterogeneity in ASD.\n\nOur finding of significant between-group differences in CT aligns with previous investigations into the neuroanatomical underpinnings of ASD, where both increased and decreased CT has been reported predominantly in fronto-temporal and frontoparietal regions (39-41). In these regions, measures of CT also undergo an abnormal developmental trajectory in ASD (42,43), with differences being most prominent during childhood and adolescence and diminishing during adulthood (44). The results of most prior studies in samples of $N<200$ have been highly variable with regards to the direction and pattern of CT differences observed. However, a more consistent picture is now emerging across an increasing number of large-scale investigations ( $N>500$ ) which typically exclusively report increased CT in ASD (e.g. $(5,44)$. Our results thus differ from these latter studies in that we also observed CT reductions in the DLPFC and precentral gyrus. This discrepancy may be due partly to differences in sample"

However, the pattern of effect sizes for the main effect of group is remarkably similar across studies (see also (12)), with the largest effects being reported in the STS, DLPFC, and PCC. Thus, taken together, the data from our study and others strongly supports the hypothesis that CT and related aspects of the vertical organization of the cortex (e.g. cortical lamination (45)) are atypical in ASD, and particularly in brain regions that are functionally linked to symptoms and traits (reviewed in (4)).\n\nASD individuals also manifested as neuroanatomical outliers in a number of brain regions that were not highlighted by the main effect of group, e.g. medial prefrontal regions, where falling outside the neurotypical $\\mathrm{PI}_{90 \\%}$ was associated with increased ASD risk in our sample. Within these brain regions, the pattern and degree (i.e. percentage) of vertex-level outliers varied considerably across individuals, with larger $t A I_{e}$ being indicative of more severe symptoms across DSM-5 domains. However, being a neuroanatomical outlier based on $t A I_{e}$ was not specific to ASD. For instance, $84 \\%$ of the non-ASD individuals with mild ID fell outside the neurotypical range, and $t A I_{e}$ not only correlated with the genome-wide polygenic risk for ASD (16) but also for ADHD (28), depression (30), and schizophrenia (29) - phenotypes which are also genetically correlated with ASD (16). Thus, while our 'composite' measure of neuroanatomical atypicality may be highly sensitive to deviations from the neurotypical range, the detected outliers are not specific to diagnostic labels, and may detect other conditions associated with atypical neurodevelopment. In a next step, we therefore also examined whether the patterns of CT differences we observe are linked to ASD etiology.\n\nSimilar to Romero-Garcia (2019), we found the $t$-map of statistical between-group differences to be enriched for genes and co-expression modules that are downregulated in the ASD cortex, which in turn code for synaptic and neuronal proteins (8). Some of these modules (e.g. M12 (34)) show a significant overrepresentation of known ASD-associated genes, which are typically expressed during early (i.e. prenatal) brain development and regulate gene expression at various developmental stages $(15,46)$. In contrast, the $\\chi^{2}$-map of neuroanatomical outliers (and"

    {
      "markdown": "Cohen's $f$ effect size map) was enriched predominantly for genes upregulated in ASD, which map onto immune/inflammatory pathways (34) that are most active in the first decades of life (8). Set-based PGS across sets that are differentially expressed in ASD, and during typical brain development, also explained a larger proportion of $t A l_{s}$ variability than PGS computed on ASD risk genes $(15,16)$. This highlights that the $t$ map and $\\mathcal{L}^{2}$-outlier map are intrinsically different, i.e. the $t$-map reflects 'group-level' differences, whereas the $\\mathcal{L}^{2}$-map detects outliers within the neurotypical CT range and can therefore accommodate highly variable patterns of neuroanatomical deviations across individuals. Our findings thus agree with the notion that the effects of ASDsusceptibility genes on the brain are pleiotropic, mediated via gene regulatory mechanisms during childhood and adolescence, which result in highly individualized neuroanatomical patterns or 'fingerprints'. The examination of these patterns, rather than group differences, may therefore hold the key to stratifying and subtyping ASD.\n\nTo this aim, we further established that differences in neuroanatomical deviations are associated with distinct clinical ASD phenotypes that differed in the severity and pattern of sensory symptoms (20). These differences were primarily observed in brain regions subserving sensorimotor control (47), which has been reported to be dysregulated in ASD (48). In these brain regions, ASD individuals with moderate and severe sensory symptoms displayed predominantly negative CT deflections (i.e. $>72 \\%$ ) compared to individuals with low sensory symptoms. ASD individuals might therefore be stratified into biologically more homogeneous subgroups not only based on their absolute phenotypic difference, but also depending on how - and to what extent - they deviate from the neurotypical mean. Brain regions that differed the most between subgroups, were also enriched for genes expressed in excitatory neurons in the developing cortex (38). Despite our sample size not allowing for the direct comparison between genotypes and phenotypes, our findings therefore support the notion that a disrupted E/I balance $(22,49)$ might underpin some autism phenotypes (50), and link sensory symptoms to excitatory neurons in the developing cortex. Here, it is important to note that we examined measures of CT exclusively. Evidence suggests, however, that different aspects of the cortical architecture have distinct genetic determinants (51), contrasting phylogeny (52), and differing developmental trajectories (43). It will therefore be important to repeat our analyses using different"

Most importantly, as we did not perform an unbiased out-of-sample validation, our study is based on in-sample estimates of the neurotypical CT range rather than population norms. Even though we have examined the robustness of our results across variable models (see Supplement), it will be important to establish the model's generalization performance in the future using independent samples not only of ASD individuals but also neurotypical controls. Moreover, we examined neuroanatomical outliers based on the GLM, which made it possible to link group-differences to patterns of neuroanatomical deviations within the same framework. Future work is therefore needed to replicate our findings using alternative 'normative modelling' approaches, e.g. employing Gaussian Process Regression (13), that are not confined to linear relationships exclusively. Also, we examined measures of CT exclusively. Last, our GEDA was based on the AHBA, which is the most comprehensive gene-expression atlas to date. However, the AHBA is based on adult donors exclusively and provides a coverage that is significantly lower than the spatial resolution of our neuroimaging data. We therefore acknowledge the importance of repeating the analyses in high-resolution age-specific gene-expression datasets, once these become available, to corroborate the important link between molecular and macroscopic pathology in ASD.\n\n# References \n\n1.

Genomic underpinnings of neurodevelopmental deviations in cortical thickness (CT) in ASD based on (A) the $t$-map of statistical between-group differences in CT (see Figure 1a), the Cohen's $f$ effect size map associated with the main effect of group (see Figure 1d), and the $\\chi^{2}$ - map of neuroanatomical ASD outliers (see Figure 2e). (B) Significant Odds-ratios (OR) at an 'false discovery rate' (FDR)-corrected $p<0.05$ resulting from the gene set enrichment analyses for genes expressed in the different output maps. Gene sets were subdivided into sets with differential gene expression (DGE) in ASD, and sets representing ASD risk genes that contain either common variants (ASD.risk.common) or rare de novo variants (ASD.risk.DeNovo). Gene sets are annotated and labelled based on their original publication. up: upregulated expression in ASD, down: down-regulated expression in ASD, CTX: cortex, DEG: differentially expressed genes.
