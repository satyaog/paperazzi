Quantifying canonical (exonic) and non-canonical MAPs-encoding RNA expression in malignant and benign cells is critical for identifying tumor antigens (TAs) but represents a challenge for immunologists. We present BamQuery, a computational tool attributing an exhaustive RNA expression to MAPs of any origin (exon, intron, UTR, intergenic) from bulk and single-cell RNA-sequencing data. We show that non-canonical MAPs (including TAs) can derive from multiple different genomic regions (up to 35,343 for EREs), abundantly expressed in normal tissues. We also show that supposedly tumor-specific mutated MAPs, viral MAPs, and MAPs derived from proteasomal splicing can arise from different unmutated non-canonical genomic regions. The genome-wide approach of BamQuery allows comprehensive mapping of all MAPs in healthy and cancer tissues. BamQuery can also help predict MAP immunogenicity and identify safe and actionable TAs.\n\n\nKEYWORDS: immunopeptidome; computational biology; major histocompatibility complex; tumor antigens\n\nABBREVIATIONS: MAP: MHC-I associated peptide; TA: Tumor antigen; ncMAP: noncanonical MAP; ncRNA: non-coding RNA; ERE: Endogenous retroelement; MCS: MAP coding sequence; ncMCS: non-canonical MCS; RPHM: Read-per-hundred-million; mTEC: Medullary thymic epithelial cell; DC: Dendritic cell; TSA: Tumor-specific antigen; CTA: Cancer-testis antigen; DLBCL: Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma."

      "markdown": "# 1. INTRODUCTION \n\nThe immunopeptidome is the repertoire of MHC-I-associated peptides (MAPs) that represents in real-time the landscape of the intracellular proteome as it is molded by protein translation and degradation ${ }^{1}$. In recent years, immunopeptidomic data has been harvested to identify relevant and targetable tumor antigens. Indeed, MAPs deriving from mutations characterizing the neoplastic transformation (mutated tumor antigens (TA), also known as neoantigens) can be recognized by cytotoxic T cells and used as anti-cancer therapeutic targets ${ }^{2}$.\n\nThe immunopeptidome is typically assumed to result from the degradation of canonical proteins, coded by exons and translated from known open-reading frames. However, recent proteogenomics (proteomic informed by genomics such as RNA sequencing (RNA-seq)) findings evidenced that $\\sim 5-10 \\%$ MAPs can also derive from non-canonical (nc) regions of the genome, such as introns, non-coding RNAs (ncRNA) or endogenous retroelements (EREs), as well as from out-of-frame translation of exons ${ }^{3-5}$. While $99 \\%$ of somatic mutations are located in noncoding regions ${ }^{6}$, the vast majority of the discovered ncMAPs are non-mutated ${ }^{4,7-10}$. Many ncMAPs are found exclusively in cancer cells and attract attention as (1) they can be immunogenic in vitro as well as in vivo; (2) they are more numerous in the immunopeptidome of malignant cells than mutated TAs and (3) several non-coding TAs are widely-shared between cancer patients whereas mutations mainly generate private antigens ${ }^{11,}{ }^{12}$. In the context of proteogenomics usage, ncMAPs discovery and actionable TAs identification have raised three challenges that are often addressed inconsistently by immunologists.\n\nFirst, the attribution of an exact RNA expression to MAPs. Typically, proteogenomic pipelines quantify MAPs RNA expression through the estimation of their parental transcript expression by using conventional transcript abundance quantification tools. However, such tools cannot be used reliably for ncMAPs which often derive from unannotated genomic regions. Furthermore, such approaches do not consider that MAPs (8-11 residues) could derive from multiple regions of the genome due to the degeneracy of the genetic code. Therefore, studies failing to consider all genomic regions susceptible to generating a given MAP would underestimate its RNA expression.\n\nSecond, the attribution of a biotype to MAPs. Due to the multiplicity of genomic regions able to generate the same MAP, and possibly having different biotypes, a MAP could be mislabeled for example as ERE-derived while a canonical region could also generate it through out-of-frame translation.\n\nThe third challenge is to prioritize TAs. Ideally, TAs should be immunogenic and specifically expressed (or overexpressed) by malignant cells ${ }^{13}$. Because RNA expression is a reliable proxy of the MAP presentation probability ${ }^{8,}{ }^{14}$, RNA-seq data of tumor and normal samples are powerful tools to perform TA prioritization. While tumor specificity can be evaluated by comparing MAP RNA expression between tumor and normal samples, evaluating MAPs RNA expression in medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTECs) should be a good predictor"

However, for the reasons mentioned above, comparing reliably MAPs RNA expression between tumors, their paired normal samples, and mTECs requires considering all their possible genomic regions of origin.\n\nTo address these challenges, we developed BamQuery, an annotation-independent tool that enables the attribution of an exhaustive RNA expression profile to any MAP of interest in any RNA-seq dataset of interest.\n\n# 2. RESULTS \n\n## Exhaustive capture of MAPs RNA expression\n\nBecause genomic annotations cover vast regions that are unlikely to represent accurately the local RNA expression of an 8-11 residues peptide (especially for ncMAPs deriving from introns, Extended Data Fig. 1a) and because no annotations are available for MAPs deriving from intergenic regions, we designed BamQuery to evaluate MAPs RNA expression independently of annotations. Due to the small size of MAP-coding sequences (MCS, 24-33 nucleotides), counting the RNA-seq reads containing each MCS able to code for a given peptide is the most thorough and less error-prone method to evaluate MAPs RNA expression. To make BamQuery readily available, it had to work on a broadly used data format. Given that querying MCS in fastq files is time-consuming ( $>1$ minute / MCS), we designed BamQuery to work on bam files in five steps (Fig. 1a, and Methods): (1) reverse-translation of each MAP into all possible MCS; (2) mapping of MCS to the genome using STAR ${ }^{16}$ to identify those having perfect matches with the reference and attribute them a genomic location. At this step, we also include to the reference genome the mutations from the dbSNP annotations ${ }^{17}$ to enable the mapping of mutated sequences; (3) counting of the primary RNA-seq reads encompassing exactly the MCS at their respective location ( $\\sim 0.0005$ minute / MCS / location) and sum read counts of each MAP across locations; (4) normalization of the read count of each MAP by the total primary alignment read count of the sample and multiplication by $1 \\times 10^{8}$ to yield read-per-hundred-million (RPHM) numbers and (5) attribution of biotypes to MAPs based on the reference annotations overlapping the various expressed (RPHM>0) regions.\n\nTo test BamQuery, we collected robustly validated benign MAPs from the HLA Ligand Atlas ${ }^{18}$ (1,702 canonical MAPs shared across at least 20 tissues, Extended Data Fig. 1b,c) and queried them in the transcriptome of eight mTEC samples sequenced previously ${ }^{9,19}$. As a control, we used the primary reads contained in the mTEC bam files previously aligned with STAR to generate databases of 27-nucleotide-long k-mers (reads chunked into smaller sequences) and queried these databases for all possible 27-mer-MCSs encoding 9-amino acid-long MAPs (1,211/1,702). Despite rare discrepancies possibly due to limitations of the STAR aligner in BamQuery, the comparison of read counts between BamQuery and k-mer databases showed an"

Next, we compared BamQuery to Kallisto ${ }^{20}$, a transcript abundance quantification tool (reference MAPs RNA quantification method) that was chosen because it provides results similar to other tools while having the fastest computing speed ${ }^{21}$. A poor correlation between Kallisto and BamQuery was found (Fig. 1c) as most Kallisto measurements were skewed toward lower values than BamQuery's. Specifically, Kallisto did not detect expression for 32 MAPs while BamQuery reported considerable RPHM values. In fact, BamQuery revealed that these MAPs are the result of multiple genomic locations (mean $=11$ ) and are completely lost when only a single MAP source transcript is quantified (Extended Data Fig. 1e,f), as is typically done with transcript abundance quantification tools. Overall, these results evidence the accuracy and superiority of BamQuery over conventional approaches."

      "markdown": "BamQuery attributed a genomic location to 100\\% MAPs: among canonical MAPs, all originally annotated genes were attributed to their respective MAP by BamQuery and among a large list of well-annotated ncMAPs ${ }^{8}$, the originally annotated genomic location was re-located by BamQuery with an accuracy of $100 \\%$.\n\nComparing all 9-mers together (to prevent biases due to differences of length proportions), a higher number of possible MCS (total number of MCS after reverse-translation) was found for non-canonical vs canonical MAPs, especially for those mapping to introns and EREs (Fig. 2a). To better understand this bias, we investigated whether this could be linked to the degeneracy of codons. We found that residues encoded by six synonymous codons (R/L/S) were enriched in intron- and ERE-derived MAPs, with leucine being the most enriched (Fig. 2b-c). Previously, we observed that MAP source transcripts use rare codons more frequently than transcripts that do not generate MAPs ${ }^{4}$. Therefore, we hypothesized that ncMAPs would use rare codons more frequently than canonical ones. Indeed, we found that the genomic codon frequency of residues encoded by 6 synonymous codons (R/L/S) was on average lower than those encoded by lower numbers of synonymous codons (Extended Data Fig. 2a) and that the codons of ncMCS presented a lower genomic frequency than canonical ones (Fig. 2d). As rare codons are rate limiting for protein synthesis ${ }^{24-26}$ and as MAPs derive frequently from defective ribosomal products (DRiPs) generated by alterations of protein synthesis rate ${ }^{27}$, our data suggest that DRiPs contribute more to the generation of ncMAPs than to canonical ones.\n\nNext, we analyzed the relation between the number of possible MCS per MAP (i.e., diversity of synonymous codons) and the number of genomic regions able to code for a given MAP. Canonical MAPs essentially derived from a single genomic location ( $60 \\%$ ), while noncanonical MAPs could derive from multiple regions (Fig. 2e). ERE MAPs presented the greatest numbers of possible regions, in agreement with their repeated nature (between 1.536 and $2.9 \\times 10^{6}$ possible regions). However, their number of possible MCS did not correlate with the number of possible locations, showing that amino acid residue composition cannot be used to predict the number of possible regions of origin (Fig. 2f).\n\nFinally, given the multiplicity of possible regions of origin, we computed the most likely biotype of each MAP. For this, we used machine learning (expectation-maximization algorithm) to rank the biotypes (in-frame, intron, ERE, etc.) as a function of their likelihood of generating the reads covering them across the whole set of GTEx tissues. In general, canonical in-frame transcripts are more likely translated than non-canonical ones. For this reason, BamQuery's best guess automatically ranks as \"in-frame\" any MAP having at least one in-frame canonical origin, which was the case for all canonical MAPs from our dataset (Extended Data Fig. 2b). BamQuery can also attribute biotypes based only on the likelihood ranks (considering the number of reads overlapping each transcript). In this case, $\\sim 26 \\%$ of canonical MAPs were assigned with a greater probability to ncRNAs (Fig. 2g). Furthermore, while ncRNA and intron MAPs were predicted to belong mainly from their identified biotype ( 73 and $81 \\%$ ) (Extended Data Fig. 2c), only $56 \\%$ of ERE-derived MAPs were estimated to derive from EREs, and $6 \\%$ of them could derive from"

Therefore, we sought to perform single-cell analyses using BamQuery. Given the end-bias of the Chromium library design typically used in scRNA-seq, we evaluated whether read coverage would allow BamQuery analyses of canonical and non-canonical MAPs in cancerous ${ }^{30}$ and normal ${ }^{31}$ lung tissues scRNA-seq data. As expected, reads showed a bias toward the 3' end of the canonical genes (Extended Data Fig. 3a). However, the coverage extended far from the 3' end, in agreement with a report detecting mutations in various regions of the gene body ${ }^{32}$. We also found a surprisingly high ( $\\sim 50 \\%$ of reads) and homogeneous read coverage in introns and ERE regions, in agreement with previous reports ${ }^{33,34}$, and suggesting that BamQuery would be able to detect expression for ncMAPs in scRNA-seq.\n\nBamQuery detected expression for 50-60\\% of the canonical and non-canonical MAPs (Supplementary Table 1) in scRNA-seq, while $86 \\%$ were found in bulk RNA-seq of GTEx lung samples (Fig. 3a). This lower number of MAPs expressed on single-cell data resulting from lower read coverage did not hamper the feasibility of scRNA-seq analyses. Indeed, canonical MAPs were uniformly expressed at the 5 ' and 3 ' ends of their transcripts (Fig. 3b). Also, the expressed rate of intronic and ERE MAPs in scRNA-seq data was more comparable to bulk RNA-seq data than canonical MAPs (Fig. 3c). This likely results from the more homogeneous read coverage observed in non-coding than in coding regions (Extended Data Fig. 3a).\n\nTherefore, we explored the patterns of MAPs expression in normal and malignant lungs. Differential expression analysis showed that $12.86 \\%$ (186/1446) and $16.46 \\%$ (248/1506) of MAPs presented cell type-specific expression profiles in normal and malignant samples, respectively (Fig. 3d and Supplementary Tables 3-4). Several differentially expressed MAPs derived from genes having cell type-specific functions such as YTAVVPLVY in B cells (immunoglobulin J polypeptide), STFQQMWISK in muscle cells (Beta-actin-like protein 2), and FLLFPDMEA in macrophages (complement C1q B chain) (Extended Data Fig. 3b). To further assess the reliability of MAP expression, we re-clustered the normal lung dataset based uniquely on MAPs expression. This provided a clear separation of the hematopoietic and stromal compartments (Fig. 3e, Extended Data Fig. 3c) and allowed the clustering of specific cell populations such as alveolar cells or the monocytes and macrophages (Extended Data Fig. 3d,e). Strikingly, most MAPs identified as differentially expressed in the normal lung dataset had an expression restricted to either the hematopoietic or stromal lineages, showing a clear dichotomy between these two compartments in terms of MAP expression (Extended Data Fig. 3f)."

Indeed, MAPs of cluster 1 were expressed by a limited number of cancer cells, whereas MAPs of cluster 2 were ubiquitously expressed, making them more desirable immunotherapeutic targets.

First, we examined 1,062 colorectal cancer (CRC) TAs identified by their presence and absence from the immunopeptidome of malignant and paired benign cells, respectively ${ }^{35}$. To evaluate their probability of being presented by normal cells, we queried them in 3 datasets: GTEx, mTECs, and sorted dendritic cells (DCs) ${ }^{36,37}$ (Supplementary Table 2). Four percent of TAs presented an expression $<8.55$ RPHM (minimum expression required to result in a probability $>5 \\%$ of generating a $\\mathrm{MAP}^{8}$ ) in all normal tissues, except for testis, as these antigens would be classified as cancer-testis antigens (CTAs) (Fig. 4a). Strikingly, among the 7 TAs reported previously as being lowly expressed at RNA level in normal matched tissues, BamQuery revealed that only one (KYLEKYYNL) presented a low expression across all peripheral tissues. Finally, no expression was found for the RYLAVAAVF peptide (the only mutated TA reported in this study), while its wild-type counterpart was highly expressed, making it a promising target for CRC immunotherapies (Fig. 4b).\n\nSecond, we wondered whether mutated TAs would be as tumor-specific as expected. We analyzed 45 8-11 amino acid long mutated peptides ( 7 from gene fusions, 28 from aberrant splice junctions, and 10 from single nucleotide variations, SNV) reported as tumor-specific in medulloblastoma (no RNA expression in GTEx) ${ }^{38}$. BamQuery could attribute a genomic location to 39 of them and mapped 7/10 SNV peptides to their reported genes (Extended Data Fig. 4a). Unexpectedly, BamQuery attributed non-discontinued (\"unspliced\") expressed genomic locations to $82 \\%$ of fusion and spliced peptides, evidencing that non-mutated (and mostly non-canonical, Fig. 4c) genomic regions could also code for those peptides. Overall, only 26 of 45 TAs presented low expression in normal tissues (Extended Data Fig. 4b) including all detected SNVderived peptides. Therefore, we wondered whether mutated MAPs reported as cancer-specific in previous publications and public databases ${ }^{10,39,40}$ would be verified as such by BamQuery. From 323 mutated TAs (Supplementary Table 5), 23 (7\\%) were highly expressed in normal tissues where $25 \\%$ of the peptides have more than 5 non-mutated genomic locations perfectly matching their MCS (Fig. 4d).\n\nThird, we examined 6 ERE-derived MAPs reported as TAs (lowly expressed in normal tissues, including mTECs, and highly expressed in multiple cancer specimens) in triple-negative breast cancer ${ }^{41}$. While the original study identified an average of 8 locations for these peptides, BamQuery identified $\\sim 66$ locations per MAP (Fig. 4e). Moreover, these MAPs showed higher expression in normal breast samples compared to cancer samples (Fig. 4f). These results highlight the importance of considering all genomic locations able to generate a given MAP when measuring RNA expression."

Fifteen could be generated by expressed regions (Fig. 4 g ), suggesting a possible misclassification of these peptides.

As we could not enable searches on GTEx (due to restricted use of these data), we included queries of MAPs in mTECs and DCs ${ }^{36,37}$ (Supplementary Table 2) as a proxy of tumor-specificity and immunogenicity. While expression in mTECs is considered a good proxy for normal cell expression ${ }^{49,50}$, we showed previously that mTECs share more transcriptomic features with epithelial than hematopoietic cells ${ }^{8}$. Prioritizing TAs based only on mTECs would therefore not be sufficient and we included DCs as they exert a non-redundant role in central tolerance establishment with $\\mathrm{mTECs}^{51}$.\n\nTo validate this choice, we randomly selected $10 \\%$ of hematopoietic-specific $(2,429)$ and $10 \\%$ of epithelium-specific $(3,237)$ MAPs from the HLA ligand atlas (Extended Data Fig. 6a, b). We queried their expression in mTECs, DCs, GTEx epithelial tissues, and a set of hematopoietic cells (Supplementary Table 2). At the RNA level, DCs and mTECs presented the highest hematopoietic and epithelial MAPs expression levels, respectively (Extended Data Fig. 6c, d). We refined our analysis by focusing on hematopoietic and epithelial MAPs being lowly ( $<8.55$ RPHM) expressed in mTECs and DCs, respectively. This revealed dramatically higher expression of hematopoietic and epithelial MAPs in hematopoietic (highest in DCs) and epithelial tissues (highest in mTECs), respectively (Fig. 6a, b). We conclude that MAPs lowly expressed in mTECs are highly expressed in DCs, and vice-versa.\n\nNext, we tested whether MAPs expression in mTECs and DCs would predict their immunogenicity. We queried in mTECs and DCs 1,180 and 4,917 non-mutated human MAPs verified experimentally as immunogenic and non-immunogenic, respectively, and curated in Ogishi et al. ${ }^{47}$. Immunogenic MAPs presented a lower expression than non-immunogenic MAPs in both types of samples (Fig. 6c). On this dataset, we trained a logistic regression model to classify immunogenic and non-immunogenic MAPs using the RPHM values of mTECs and DCs as features. Measurements of model performance and robustness using the cross-validation method (area under the ROC curve (AUC) $=\\sim 0.75$, Extended Data Fig. 6e) showed that the RPHM values of MAPs in mTECs and DCs are predictors of MAP immunogenicity.\n\nFinally, we evaluated whether MAP expression in both mTECs and DCs reflects the probability of presentation in benign tissues. Using $10 \\%$ of random MAPs from the HLA Ligand Atlas $(8,694)$, we found that MAPs lowly expressed in both mTECs and DCs were less presented (Fig. 6d) and expressed (Fig. 6e) in tissues of the HLA Ligand Atlas and GTEx, respectively. Upon examination of these MAPs features, we found that the probability of being highly expressed in mTECs and DCs increased exponentially with the number of possible genomic regions (Fig. 6f). Altogether, these results show that concomitant expression in mTECs and DCs expression is a reliable proxy of the presentation/expression in benign tissues and that MAPs having fewer possible regions of origin have a greater probability of being safe-to-target TAs."

      "markdown": "# 3. DISCUSSION \n\nFuelled by studies focused on TAs, the immunopeptidomics field is expanding rapidly ${ }^{3,52,53}$. This expansion comes with an impressive diversity of homemade methodological approaches addressing the challenges raised by the characterization of non-canonical and mutated MAPs. Specifically, the fact that $\\sim 75 \\%$ of the human genome can be transcribed ${ }^{54}$ (and therefore possibly translated) evidenced the necessity of examining the expression of each region able to code for a presumed TA. BamQuery was designed not only to enable such examination but also to enable a uniformization of TA validation approaches across laboratories.\n\nThe recent discovery that a significant fraction of the immunopeptidome derives from non-coding regions has brought the contribution of the \"dark genome\" into the spotlight ${ }^{2}$. Since then, multiple studies have attempted to characterize cryptic MAPs, most often by using mass spectrometry informed by databases dedicated to the identification of specific classes of ncMAPs (intron-derived, ERE-derived, etc.) ${ }^{7,19,55}$. However, these approaches suffer from their dedication as the identified MAPs could also derive from other transcripts, absent from these databases. Accordingly, based on evidence showing that greater RNA expression confers a greater probability of MAPs generation ${ }^{7,13}$, we implemented a biotype annotation tool in BamQuery and showed that many presumed ncMAPs could be coded with greater probability by regions annotated with different biotypes. Strikingly, an important fraction of the canonical MAPs $(\\sim 30 \\%)$ could also be translated, with a greater probability, from non-canonical regions. While this result requires more in-depth analyses to elucidate the true origin of these MAPs, this possible dramatic contribution of the non-coding genome to the immunopeptidome is a sobering thought given that cryptic proteins are translated as efficiently as canonical proteins and generate MAPs 5-fold more efficiently per translation event ${ }^{5}$.\n\nTherapies targeting truly tumor-specific antigens can be highly effective ${ }^{56}$, while those targeting antigens unsuspectedly expressed by normal cells can be lethal for patients ${ }^{57}$. Notably, BamQuery evidenced a high expression of many TAs, including mutated and ERE MAPs, in normal tissues, resulting from previously unreported coding regions and suggesting that targeting them would be unsafe. Here, we acknowledge that our approach can be considered very cautious. Indeed, by summing the RNA-seq reads of all regions able to code a given TA, BamQuery does not consider that possibly only one region is translated and generates MAPs. Eventually, the availability of RIBO-seq data (which can be analyzed with BamQuery as well) could help to address this question. Meanwhile, in the absence of tools robustly predicting the translational origin of MAPs, the approach reported herein is the most circumspect for TA selection. Ideally, we recommend prioritizing TAs with a single possible region of origin (with cancer-specific expression) because other regions cannot code for such TAs in normal tissues.\n\nThanks to its exhaustivity, speed, ease of use, and versatility (bulk \\& single-cell RNA-seq + RIBO-seq, usable with mouse or human genome, on any kind of wild-type or mutated MAPs),"

As peptide input, BamQuery supports three different formats that can be pulled into a single input file.\nA) Peptide mode: only the amino acid sequence of the MAP is provided, hence BamQuery performs a comprehensive search for its RNA-seq expression. All results reported in the present article were obtained with this mode.\nB) MAP coding sequence (MCS) mode: the amino acid sequence of the MAP is provided, hence BamQuery performs the search for the expression of the given MCS only.\nC) Manual mode: the amino acid sequence of the MAP is provided followed by an MCS, the corresponding location in the genome of the given MCS, and the strand (+ forward or - reverse), whereby BamQuery performs the expression search at the given location for the given MCS at the given genomic location and strand (useful to evaluate the expression of mutated MAPs whose genomic location is known but which cannot be located by BamQuery due to unavailable annotations in dbSNP or STAR failure).\n\nBamQuery performs five important steps for each peptide queried.\n\n## 1) Reverse translation of MAPs.\n\nEach input MAP in peptide mode is reverse-translated into all possible MCS. The MCS are compiled into a fastq file.\n\n## 2) Identification of genomic locations.\n\nMCS are then mapped to the reference genome (user-defined, meaning that several genome versions are supported (GENCODE 26, 33 or 38)) using STAR v2.7.9.a ${ }^{16}$ running with default parameters except for --seedSearchStartLmax, --winAnchorMultimapNmax, -outFilterMultimapNmax, --limitOutSJcollapsed, --limitOutSAMoneReadBytes, -alignTranscriptsPerWindowNmax, --seedNoneLociPerWindow, --seedPerWindowNmax, -alignTranscriptsPerReadNmax that were replaced by 20, 10.000, 10.000, 5.000.000 , 2.660.000, $1.000,1.000,1.000,20.000$, respectively.

Therefore, each alignment included in Aligned.out.sam is exanimated to compare the read sequence nucleotide by nucleotide against the reference genomic sequence at that position (assessed using the samtools fetch command within python via the pysam (https://github.com/pysam-developers/pysam) library at the genomic location of the given alignment).

To reduce the complexity of tracing perfect STAR alignments, only single nucleotide variants (SNVs) of dbSNP annotations were considered to define perfect alignments.\n\n# 3) MAP RNA-seq reads counting. \n\nNext, the expression of each MCS is queried in each BAM file (CRAM files are also supported) using the samtools view ${ }^{58}$ command within python via the pysam library (only primary alignment reads (pysam option -F0X100), originally present in fastq files, are queried) at their respective genomic location. BamQuery supports RNA-seq unstrandedness / strandedness libraries (userdefined parameter, default: strandedness). To collect reads in unstranded libraries, the -F0X100 option is used in the pysam view command. In stranded libraries, depending on the sequencing reads type (single-end, paired-end), library preparation (forward or backward) and sense of the MCS genomic location (forward or backward), the options in the pysam view command are: -F0X100 \\& -f0X50 for R1 mate and -F0X100 \\& -f0XA0 for R2 mate in paired-end, forward library and reverse genomic location; -F0X100 \\& -f0X60 for R1 mate and -F0X100 \\& -f0X90 for R2 mate in paired-end, forward library and forward genomic location; -F0X110 for R1 mate in single-end, forward library and forward genomic location; -F0X100 \\& -f10 for R1 mate in singleend, forward library and reverse genomic location; -F0X100 \\& -f0X60 for R1 mate and -F0X100 \\& -f0X90 for R2 mate in paired-end, reverse library and reverse genomic location; -F0X100 \\& f0X50 for R1 mate and -F0X100 \\& -f0XA0 for R2 mate in paired-end, reverse library and forward genomic location; -F0X110 for R1 mate in single-end, reverse library and reverse genomic location; -F0X100 \\& -f10 for R1 mate in single-end, reverse library and forward genomic location. The retrieved reads are examined one by one and counted if they exactly span the queried MCS at the genomic location. Therefore, each retrieved read is transformed into a list in Python and its alignment location is transformed into an array containing the location of each amino acid in the read. The indices of the array locations corresponding to the first and last amino acid locations in the MCS at a given genomic location are used to extract from the read list the subsequence that is compared to the MCS. If both the MCS and the subsequence of a retrieved read are the same, the read count for the current MCS increases by one. Finally, the total read count $\\left(\\operatorname{tr}_{\\text {MAP }}\\right)$ for a given MAP is computed by summing all RNA-seq reads from all MCS genomic locations.\n\n## 4) Normalization.\n\nThe $\\operatorname{tr}_{\\text {MAP }}$ count is transformed into \"reads per hundred million\" values (RPHM) by normalizing them with the total number of primary reads sequenced (corresponding to the total read number present in fastq files) according to the formula: $\\mathrm{RPHM}=\\frac{\\mathrm{tr}_{\\mathrm{MAP}}}{\\mathrm{R}_{\\mathrm{t}}}+10^{\\mathrm{g}}$ where $\\mathrm{R}_{\\mathrm{t}}$ represents the total number of primary RNA-seq reads of the sample. These final values are log-transformed $\\log _{10}(\\mathrm{RPHM}+1)$ to allow comparison and averaging between samples, thus removing the bias of large values."

The complete list of biotypes annotated by BamQuery based on RepeatMasker and GENCODE can be consulted at http://bamquery.iric.ca/biotype_classification.html.\n\nGiven that MAPs may have alignments in regions where several different biotypes overlap (such as protein-coding transcripts overlapping with non-coding RNAs, see the example shown in Extended Data Fig. 7a), we used the expectation-maximization (EM) statistical model to estimate, for each biotype, the read distribution coefficient. In this model, reads at each genomic location are weighted for each biotype at the given location according to their coefficients and consequently, the biotype of each MAP is scored according to the percentage of reads corresponding to each biotype (in-frame, introns, ncRNA, ERE, etc.). The EM algorithm iterates between the expectation (E) and maximization (M) step until the parameter set of the last iteration is unchanged, therefore finding the parameter set that maximizes the posterior probability of the observed data, in our case the reads that overlap with one or more biotypes. To train the EM algorithm, we first collected canonical and ncMAPs (Supplementary Table 1) and ran BamQuery on normal and cancer datasets (normal: GTEx and mTECs, cancer: TCGA) to obtain the total reads covering each MAP at each MCS genome location. We then computed the probability of each biotype as follows:\n\nLet $\\varnothing=\\left(\\varnothing_{\\mathrm{A}}, \\varnothing_{\\mathrm{B}}, \\varnothing_{\\mathrm{c}} \\ldots\\right)$, be the set of parameters to estimate, where $\\varnothing_{\\mathrm{A}}, \\varnothing_{\\mathrm{B}}, \\varnothing_{\\mathrm{c}} \\ldots$ are the probabilities that the read belongs to the In_frame (A), non_coding_exon (B), intron (C), etc. biotypes. EM starts with an arbitrary initial estimation of 0.1 for each biotype's probability. In the E-step, the distribution of the total number of reads for each MAP is computed using the current biotype's parameters, as follows:\nLet $\\mathrm{R}_{\\mathrm{i}}=$ total reads of $\\mathrm{MAP}_{\\mathrm{i}}$\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{Z}\\left(\\varnothing_{\\mathrm{i}}^{\\mathrm{t}}, \\mathrm{~L}_{\\mathrm{i}}\\right)=\\frac{\\sum_{\\mathrm{k}=1}^{\\mathrm{L}}\\left(\\mathrm{r}_{\\mathrm{k}} * \\frac{\\varnothing_{\\mathrm{i}}^{\\mathrm{t}}}{\\sum_{\\mathrm{h}=1}^{\\beta} \\varnothing_{\\mathrm{h}}^{\\mathrm{k}}}\\right)}{\\mathrm{R}_{\\mathrm{i}}}\n$$\n\nWhere $\\varnothing_{\\mathrm{i}}^{\\mathrm{t}}$ is the current probability for biotype j in $\\mathrm{MAP}_{\\mathrm{i}} . \\mathrm{L}_{\\mathrm{i}}$ is the MCS genome locations for $\\mathrm{MAP}_{\\mathrm{i}} . \\mathrm{r}_{\\mathrm{k}}$ is the number of reads overlapping location k and B is the set of biotypes overlapping the location k .\nIn the M-step, the new set of parameters is determined using the current computations, as follows:"

The iterative process concludes if the following condition is met for all biotypes: $\\varnothing_{j}^{t}=$ $\\varnothing_{j}^{t+1}$ and the last set of estimated parameters is used to assign the proportion of reads assigned to each biotype at any genomic location.\n\nTherefore, BamQuery scores for each MAP the biotype as the percentage of reads assigned to each biotype class (in-frame, introns, ncRNA, ERE, etc.). For example, a canonical MAP with alignments in non-canonical regions could be indicated as follows In_frame: 84.09\\% - Intronic: $15.91 \\%$, meaning that $\\sim 84 \\%$ of the total reads overlap with a known transcript and that the MAP is within the known protein frame, while $\\sim 16 \\%$ of the reads overlap with transcripts in an intronic region.\n\nBamQuery informs the biotype of each MAP in three different settings, as follows:\n\n1. Biotype computed for each MCS genome location: BamQuery reports the percentage contribution of the biotypes overlapping the given location. The percentage of each biotype is calculated as the coefficient of each biotype normalized by the sum of the coefficients of all biotypes in the location, as follows:\n\n$$\n\\varnothing_{i, j}^{k}=\\frac{\\varnothing_{i, j}^{k}}{\\sum_{b=1}^{B} \\varnothing_{b}^{k}}\n$$\n\nWhere $\\varnothing_{i, j}^{k}$ is the coefficient assigned to the biotype $j$ for the $\\mathrm{MAP}_{j}$ at the location $k$.\n2. Biotype computed from all MCS genome locations found in the set of queried samples: the biotype of each MAP is assigned based on the total read count in the sample set. This calculation follows three steps:\na. The total number of reads in each MCS genome location is distributed according to the biotype percentages assigned to the location in the previous step.\nb. Normalization of the distributed count of reads by the total number of reads in the entire set of samples.\nc. The final biotype of each MAP is obtained by summing all normalized reads distributions across its MCS genomic location.\n3. Biotype for each subset of samples (e.g., GTEx, TCGA, mTEC samples): the biotype of each peptide is assigned following the same steps as before but according to the total count of reads in each subset of samples.\n4.

Patients having an above-median number of HE-TSAs (n=26) were compared to those below-median $(\\mathrm{n}=22)$ through a differential gene expression analysis. This analysis was conducted in R3.6.1 as reported previously ${ }^{62}$.

Functional annotations with p-value $<0.05$ were considered significant. The GO-term"

      "markdown": "list was then imported in Cytoscape v3.7.2 and used to cluster redundant GO terms and visualize the results with EnrichmentMap v3.2.1 and default parameters. The network was visualized using the default \"Prefuse Force-Directed Layout\" in Cytoscape. Groups of similar GO terms were manually circled.\n\n# Other bioinformatic analyses \n\nAmino acid compositions were assessed with the ProtParam module of Biopython. Read coverage in scRNA-seq data was evaluated with the geneBody_coverage module of RSeQC on the bam file generated by CellRanger. Codon frequencies were obtained from the codon usage database (http://www.kazusa.or.jp/codon/).\n\n## Logistic regression model\n\nThe cross-validation procedure was used to split the training data set into training and validation subsets using the StratifiedShuffleSplit function of the sklearn python library with 10 numbers of splits and 0.2 for test size. Next, the logistic regression model of the sklearn python library was used to classify immunogenic and non-immunogenic MAPs with the default parameters except for the liblinear solver.\n\n## Construction of MS database for TSA identification\n\nWe used RNA-seq data from 3 published datasets of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma samples (DLBCL) ${ }^{5}$. Cancer-specific proteomes were built using k-mer profiling as described previously ${ }^{9}$. RNA-Seq reads were chopped into 33-nucleotide k-mers and only those present $<2$ in mTECs were kept. Overlapping k-mers were assembled into contigs, which were then three-frame translated and linked using \"JJ\" as separators. This database was concatenated with each sample's canonical proteome for MAP identification.\n\n## Quantification and Statistical Analysis\n\nAll statistical tests used are mentioned in the respective figure legends. For all statistical tests, *, **, ***, **** and $* * * *$ refers to $\\mathrm{p}<0.05, \\mathrm{p}<0.01, \\mathrm{p}<0.001$ and $\\mathrm{p}<0.0001$, respectively, and are reported in the figures. Correlations were assessed with the Pearson or Spearman correlation coefficient, a red line in the correlation plots represents the linear regression. Plots and statistical tests were performed using scipy.stats and seaborn packages of Python v3.6.8. Unless mentioned otherwise, all boxes in box plots show the third (75th) and first quartiles (25th) and the box band shows the median (second quartile) of the distribution; whiskers extend to 1.5 times the interquartile distance from the box. Unless mentioned otherwise, all bar plots show the average with error bars: $95 \\%$ confidence interval (CI)."
