The rigorous collection of standardized longitudinal outcomes within a patient registry that is not product-specific can facilitate research to enhance understanding of natural history and evaluate intervention effectiveness. The Canadian MPS Society and the INFORM RARE research network co-developed The Canadian MPS Registry. To facilitate a shared vision among registry partners, a set of core values was co-developed: sustainability to support long-term relevance; accessibility within and outside current networks, while maintaining participant privacy; scalability to other disease groups; recognition of the registry as a public benefit; direct benefit to patients and their families; and building capacity for research that responds to patient priorities. The registry governance structure includes a multi-disciplinary steering committee to make decisions about data collection, access, and use. The registry is hosted on the National Organisation for Rare Disorders IAMRARE ${ }^{\\circledR}$ Platform and is available in English and French. Initially, eligible participants are individuals aged 18 years or younger, diagnosed with MPS, and receiving care in Canada; expansion to adult populations is a priority. Data collection is informed by a core outcome set, developed by patients, caregivers, health care providers, and policy makers. Upon enrollment, participants are asked to complete a demographic questionnaire and patient- and/or caregiver-reported questionnaires to measure children's health-related quality of life (Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information System) and activities of daily living (Adaptive Behavior Assessment System). Additional patient/caregiver-reported outcomes (pain, mobility, sleep, and caregiver/family impact) and clinician-reported outcomes (disease progression, skeletal and joint disease, and neurologic changes) will be added. Participants own their own data and have control over its use, including sharing with external researchers. The Canadian MPS Registry will support observational and interventional research to ultimately improve care and outcomes for individuals with MPS.\ndoi:10.1016/j.ymgme.2023.107964\n\n## 226\n\nA small molecule drug, AVP6, rescues synaptic deficits in human iPSC-derived neurons across the mucopolysaccharidosis type III spectrum\n\nTravis Moore ${ }^{a}$, Patricia Dubot ${ }^{a}$, Thomas Durcan ${ }^{b}$, Alexey Pshezhetsky ${ }^{a}$, ${ }^{a}$ University of Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada, ${ }^{b}$ McGill University, Montreal, QC, Canada\n\nThe spectrum of rare neurological lysosomal diseases, mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS) III, is caused by deficiencies in one of the enzymes that catabolize heparan sulphate (HS). The disease causes a severe neurocognitive decline in affected children, leading to premature death and currently lacks a specific treatment. Previously, we identified synaptic defects as an underlying cause for memory decline in two heparan- $\\alpha$-glucosaminide- $N$ acetyltransferase (HGSNAT)-deficient mouse models of MPS IIIC. Now we confirm that a drastic reduction of pre-and post-synaptic markers for excitatory and inhibitory neurons, as well as the brainderived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), is also a common hallmark of induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived cultured cortical neurons of MPS IIIA, B and C patients. We generated iPSC lines from cultured skin fibroblasts of MPS IIIA-C patients (one female and one male patient per genotype) and sex/age matching healthy controls. We further differentiated them into neuronal progenitor cells (NPCs) and cortical neurons and confirmed a robust expression of neuronal fidelity and differentiation markers Nestin/Pax6/Tuj1/Synapsin1/ TBR1/NeuN/MAP2. MPS IIIA-C neurons retained their disease-specific primary enzymatic deficits, showed an increased LAMP2+ area, suggestive of lysosomal storage, and revealed a significant reduction of protein markers for glutamatergic (VGLUT1/PSD-95) and GABAergic (VGAT/Gephyrin) synapses and BDNF. We have identified a small molecule drug termed AVP6 that, when added to the neuronal cultures during the differentiation/maturation step, restored levels of synaptic proteins and BDNF, without correcting the lysosomal storage. Together, our results confirm synaptic deficits in iPSCderived human neurons and the potential of AVP6 as a new MPS III therapeutic.\ndoi:10.1016/j.ymgme.2023.107965\n\n## 227\n\nStudy of adult and pediatric patients with idiopathic splenomegaly and splenectomy: The PREDIGA study- PRoject for the Education and Diagnosis of Gaucher disease and Acid sphingomyelinase deficiency\n\nMarta Morado ${ }^{a}$, Jesus Villarrubia ${ }^{b}$, Isidro Vitoria ${ }^{c}$, Enrique J. Calder√≥n ${ }^{d}$, Miguel Angel Torralba Cabeza ${ }^{c}$, ${ }^{a}$ Hospital Universitario La Paz, Madrid, Spain, ${ }^{b}$ Hospital Universitario Ramon y Cajal, Madrid, Spain, ${ }^{c}$ Hospital Universitario La Fe, Valencia, Spain, ${ }^{d}$ Facultad Medicina Sevilla, Sevilla, Spain, ${ }^{e}$ Hospital Universitario Lozano Blesa, Zaragoza, Spain\n\nThe differential diagnosis of splenomegaly is a complex process that encompasses a wide variety of diseases. Moreover, it is not always standardized and lacks a definitive consensus on which tests should be performed and in what order. Gaucher disease (GD) and acid sphingomyelinase deficiency (ASMD) are 2 lysosomal diseases"
