The emerging biomedical knowledge graphs (BKGs) provide an efficient and effective way to manage the abundant knowledge in biomedical and life science. In this study, we created a comprehensive BKG called the integrative Biomedical Knowledge Hub (iBKH) by harmonizing and integrating information from diverse biomedical resources. To make iBKH easily accessible for biomedical research, we developed a webbased, user-friendly graphical portal that allows fast and interactive knowledge retrieval. Additionally, we also implemented an efficient and scalable graph learning pipeline for discovering novel biomedical knowledge in iBKH. As a proof of concept, we performed our iBKH-based method for computational in-silico drug repurposing for Alzheimer's disease. The iBKH is publicly available.\n\n## INTRODUCTION\n\nBiomedicine is a discipline with enormous volume of highly specialized biomedical knowledge accumulated from biological experiments and clinical practice. In the past decade, efforts have been drawn to collect and manage the abundant biomedical knowledge. BKG (BKG) has emerged as a novel paradigm for better management of large scale and heterogeneous biomedical knowledge and attracted significant interests in biomedicine recently. ${ }^{1-4}$ Typically, a BKG is a multi-relational graph or network that integrates, harmonizes, and stores biomedical knowledge collected from single or multiple expert-derived knowledge sources. ${ }^{1,2,4,7}$ A BKG contains a set of nodes that correspond to biomedical entities (e.g., diseases, drugs, genes, biological processes, etc.) and a set of edges that are relations linking the biomedical entities (e.g., drug-treats-disease, disease-associates-gene, and drug-interacts-drug relations.). ${ }^{1,2,4,7}$ In the past decade, large amounts of efforts have been made to construct BKGs by integrating diverse expert curated knowledge bases ${ }^{2,4,7-9}$ and extracting knowledge from literature using natural language processing techniques. ${ }^{10-12}$ As a result, many different BKGs have been built. ${ }^{13-16}$\n\nDespite the promising results achieved from existing BKG efforts, there are still limitations that hinder their utility in modern biomedical research and clinical practice. First, most of the current BKGs focus on one or a few sub-domains of biomedicine; hence they cannot characterize the human health holistically and comprehensively. ${ }^{15,16}$ This makes it challenging for efficient exploration of cross-domain biomedical knowledge to provide system-level understanding of diseases. Second, existing BKGs are mostly publicly available as raw text information of the nodes and edges therein, ${ }^{1,15}$ which requires informatics training for the end users to make full utilization of them. Thus, there remains a need for a publicly available and easy-to-use user interface (UI) to facilitate knowledge exploration on these BKGs. Third, the reasoning and inference capabilities available on existing BKGs are limited. With the revolution of deep learning technologies in NLP ${ }^{17}$ and reasoning in general domain knowledge graphs, ${ }^{18}$ there is a huge potential of making high-quality reasoning/hypothesis generation with evidence support as an addition functionality of BKG to accelerate new biomedical knowledge discovery.\n\nTo fill in the above gaps, this present study built a comprehensive BKG, termed the iBKH, through integrating information from 18 high-quality and well-curated knowledge sources.

In general, graph learning is an emerging branch of machine learning that aims at exploring knowledge from graph structured data. ${ }^{19,20}$ In recent years, they have been applied in BKG to accelerate biomedical hypothesis generation such as drug repurposing ${ }^{7,21-23}$ and disease risk gene prioritization. ${ }^{24,25}$ In iBKH, we have implemented a knowledge discovery module based on DGL-KE (Deep Graph Library Knowledge Embedding), ${ }^{26}$ the python package for efficient and scalable graph learning. To demonstrate its potentials, we conducted two proof-of-concept studies: 1) in-silico hypothesis generation for Alzheimer's disease (AD) drug repurposing and 2) enhancing data analysis of a patient cohort of older adults with Apolipoprotein E (APOE) $\\varepsilon 4$ genotype, which is a significant genetic risk factor of AD.\n\n## RESULTS\n\nFigure 1 illustrates overall pipeline of the present study, which includes the following modules including: 1) iBKH construction through biomedical knowledge integration, 2) development of graphical portal for fast knowledge retrieval based on iBKH, and 3) iBKH-based computational knowledge discovery through deep graph learning. Figure 2 illustrates the schema of our BKG, i.e., iBKH. The iBKH is publicly available at: http://ibkh.ai/.\n\n## The integrative Biomedical Knowledge Hub\n\nBy collecting, harmonizing, and integrating data from 18 publicly available biomedical knowledge sources (see Table 1), we curated a comprehensive BKG, named the iBKH. The knowledge sources include biomedical ontologies such as the BRENDA Tissue Ontology, ${ }^{27}$ the Cell Ontology ${ }^{28}$ the Disease Ontology, ${ }^{29}$ and the Uberon ${ }^{30}$; manually curated biomedical knowledge bases for biomedical entity and relation data such as the Bgee, ${ }^{31}$ the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database, ${ }^{32}$ the DrugBank, ${ }^{33}$ the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), ${ }^{34}$ the Pharmacogenetics Knowledge Base (PharmGKB), ${ }^{35}$ the Reactome, ${ }^{36}$ the Side effect resource, ${ }^{37}$ and the TISSUE ${ }^{38}$; existing BKGs curated by integrating multiple knowledge bases such as the drug repurposing knowledge graph (DRKG, https://github.com/gnn4dr/DRKG), ${ }^{39}$ the Hetionet, ${ }^{4}$ the Integrated Dietary Supplement Knowledge Base (integrated Dietary Supplements Knowledge (iDISK)), ${ }^{40}$ our curated knowledge graph that covers a variety of dietary supplements, including vitamins, herbs, minerals, etc.; and other biomedical sources such as Human Genome Organisation (HUGO) Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC), ${ }^{41}$ Chemical Biology Information Resource from EMBL [European Molecular Biology Laboratory] (ChEMBL), ${ }^{42}$ and Chemical Entities of Biological Interest (ChEBI). ${ }^{43}$ More details of the sources can be found in Table 1.\n\nAfter data management and necessary data cleaning, we integrated data from different sources through biomedical entity term normalization and knowledge integration (more details can be found in the STAR Methods section). Current version of the resulted iBKH contains a total of 2,384,501 entities of 11 types, including 23,003 anatomy entities, 19,236 disease entities, 37,997 drug entities, 88,376 gene entities (including human and other species), 2,065,015 molecule entities, 1,361 symptom entities, 2,988 pathway entities, 4,251 side effect entities, 4,101 dietary supplement ingredient (DSI) entities, 137,568 dietary supplement product (DSP) entities, and 605 dietary's therapeutic class (TC) entities (see Figure 2 and Table 2). In addition, there are 45 relation types within 18 kinds of entity pairs, including Anatomy-Gene, DrugDisease, Drug-Drug, Drug-Gene, Disease-Disease, Disease-Gene, Disease-Symptom, Gene-Gene, DSIDisease, DSI-Symptom, DSI-Drug, DSI-Anatomy, DSI-DSP, DSI-TC, Disease-Pathway, Drug-Pathway, Gene-Pathway, and Drug-Side Effect, which means multiple types of relations can exist between a pair of biomedical entities (see Table 3). Specifically, 2 types of potential relations can exist between an Anatomy-Gene pair, including \"Expresses\" and \"Absent\"; 6 relation types between a Drug-Disease pair, such as \"Treats\" and \"Effects\"; 2 relation types between a Drug-Drug pair including \"Interaction\" and \"Resembles\"; 10 relation types between a Drug-Gene pair, such as \"Targets,\" \"Upregulates,\" and \"Downregulates\"; 2 relation types between a Disease-Disease pair including \"Is_A\" and \"Resembles\"; 5 relation types between a Disease-Gene pair, such as \"Associates,\" \"Upregulates,\" and \"Downregulates\"; the \"Presents\" relation type between a Disease-Symptom pair; and 5 relation types between a Gene-Gene pair, such as \"Covaries,\" \"Interacts,\" and \"Regulates\"; the \"Has_Adverse Reaction\" relation between a DSISymptom pair; the \"Is_Effective_For\" relation type between a DSI-Disease pair; the \"Interacts\" relation type between a DSI-Drug pair; the \"Has_Adverse_Effect_On\" relation type between a DSI-Anatomy\n\nMontreal, QC H3A 0C6, Canada\n${ }^{12}$ Department of Neurology, College of Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL 32610, USA\n${ }^{14}$ Department of Health Outcomes \\& Biomedical Informatics, College of Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL 32610, USA\n${ }^{17}$ These authors contributed equally\n${ }^{18}$ Lead contact\n*Correspondence: few2001@med.cornell.edu https://doi.org/10.1016/j.iscI. 2023.106460"

We also released entity and relation source files of iBKH in comma-separated values (CSV) format, available at: https://github.com/wcm-wanglab/iBKH. Of note, the deployed version of iBKH excluded data from KEGG due to restriction.\n\n# An easy-to-use interactive online portal for fast knowledge retrieval \n\nKnowledge retrieval is the most common application scenario for a BKG like iBKH in biomedical research. In contrast to information query in the traditional databases, knowledge retrieval in the iBKH needs to match the logical and structural patterns of entities and relations. This can be done by defining graphbased queries.\n\nTo fill the gap between the iBKH and biomedical and clinical researchers to facilitate its usage, we developed a web-based graphical portal that allows users to design graph-based queries for fast knowledge retrieval in a flexible, interactive manner and visualize the retrieved knowledge immediately (see Figure 1). Specifically, our portal has two functional modules for knowledge retrieval, i.e., biomedical entity query and path query. First, the biomedical entity query allows to retrieval information of the queried entity and its"

Figure 3A illustrates an example of exploring biomedical context of the APOE gene, which produces APOE protein and is the known major risk gene for AD. ${ }^{34,45}$ By choosing DrugBank and PharmGKB in the \"Source\" section, we narrow down the query to explore entities that has relations connecting to APOE based on knowledge from the two knowledge sources. For instance, besides AD, APOE is also associated with diseases such depressive disorders, hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation, and hypertriglyceridemia, which have been reported as comorbidities of AD. APOE also has relations with drugs like zinc medications (zinc, zinc sulfate, zinc chloride, and zinc acetate) that target APOE to affect progression of AD. ${ }^{46,47}$\n\nIn addition, there is also a need for more sophisticated queries to retrieve multi-hop context information of the queried entity, which may help discover inconspicuous but meaningful knowledge from iBKH. Figure 3B illustrates an example of discovering drugs that connect to AD through the path disease[Associates_DiG] - gene - [Associats_DG] - drug, where Associates_DiG and Associates_DG denote relations in terms of the \"association\" between a pair of disease and gene and the \"association\" between a pair of gene and drug, respectively. Such a query path can be generated by iteratively defining entities and relations, combined with constraints, in our portal (see Figure 3B). The retrieved information was illustrated in Figure 3B, where we visualized 100 retrieved triplets (by setting Limit of Triplet as 100 in the portal). Centered around the disease entity AD, genes associated with it were retrieved first. Then, drugs that had been associated with these genes were retrieved, which can be considered as potential repurposable drugs for AD treatment. For instance, cyclophosphamide, a medication used as chemotherapy and to suppress the immune system, is connected to the AD through the shared neighbor INSR (insulin receptor) gene. This is in line with previous evidence that cyclophosphamide may help reduce cognitive decline in AD. ${ }^{48}$\n\n# A machine learning pipeline for iBKH-based biomedical knowledge discovery \n\nAnother important application scenario for iBKH is the discovery of unknown knowledge, e.g., missing relations among entities, based on the existing, incomplete knowledge graph. In this study, we utilized a computational method for knowledge discovery in iBKH based on the advanced graph learning approaches. ${ }^{1,19}$ Our pipeline contains two steps (see STAR Methods section and Figure 1C). First, we utilized the knowledge graph embedding (KGE) algorithms which calculate machine-readable embedding vectors for entities and/or relations in iBKH while preserving the graph structure. ${ }^{19,20,49}$ Here we utilized an efficient"

We split iBKH into $90 \\%$ training and 10\\% testing sets, where the training set was used to train KGE models, and the testing set was used for evaluating link prediction performance of the models based on multiple metrics (see STAR Methods section). Table 4 shows that the four KGE models can achieve desirable performance in link prediction in iBKH. After that, we retrained KGE models using the entire iBKH to obtain entity and relation embeddings and applied our iBKH-based knowledge discovery pipeline for in-silico hypothesis generation as detailed below.\n\n# In-silico hypothesis generation: a case study of Alzheimer's disease drug repurposing \n\nAs a proof of concept, we performed in-silico hypothesis generation for AD drug repurposing, i.e., predicting drugs that potentially connect to the AD entity (see STAR Methods section and Figure 1.). ${ }^{54-57}$ Such analysis has been used to identify repurposable drug candidates for COVID-19 in our previous study. ${ }^{57}$ In order to assess the effectiveness of our approach for predicting repurposable drugs for AD, we used a ground truth consisting of FDA-approved drugs and drugs currently being tested in clinical trials for AD treatment. This included a total of 10 FDA-approved drugs and 215 drugs in various stages of clinical trials ( 30 in Phase IV, 43 in Phase III, 95 in Phase II, and 47 in Phase I). To prevent any potential data leakage during the prediction process, all connections between the AD entity and any drug in the ground truth list were removed from the iBKH (see STAR Methods section). Figure 4 provides an overview of the performance of our method, which involved generating predictions based on embedding vectors produced by four different KGE algorithms (TransE, TransR, ComplEx, and DistMult), as well as an ensemble model that combined all four algorithms (see the STAR Methods section for more details). Our approach achieved strong prediction performance, with an AUC score over 0.83 for all methods in predicting FDA-approved AD drugs and an AUC over 0.75 in predicting both FDA-approved drugs and drugs in Phase IV clinical trials ( $n=40$ ). This suggests that our approach is particularly effective at ranking FDA-approved and Phase IV clinical trial drugs for AD. Furthermore, our ensemble model achieved even better performance (e.g., AUC $=0.9$ for FDA-approved drugs, AUC $=0.79$ for FDA-approved plus Phase IV clinical trial drugs for AD), indicating that it benefits from the use of multiple KGE algorithms.\n\nOur model can also suggest potential drug candidates for AD, which have not been approved or involved in clinical trials for AD treatment. As a proof of concept, we highlighted the top-10 ranked potential drugs for AD treatment based on the ensemble model and iBKH (see Table 5)."

Fluphenazine has been reported as a drug candidate in a recent AD drug repurposing study based on integrated network and transcriptome analysis. ${ }^{65}$ Flupentixol, on the other hand, is a 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor antagonist, which has been suggested as a potential treatment for cognitive deficits in AD. ${ }^{75,76}$\n\nWe also identified other drugs as potential candidates for AD treatment, including loperamide (DrugBank ID: DB00836), cyproheptadine (DrugBank ID: DB00434), peginterferon alfa-2b (DrugBank ID: DB00022), apomorphine (DrugBank ID: DB00714), and enoxacin (DrugBank ID: DB00467). Loperamide, commonly used to treat diarrhea, has been shown to target opioid receptors, which may be linked to AD pathology, ${ }^{58,59}$ which has been suggested to be potentially linked to AD pathology. ${ }^{60}$ Cyproheptadine, a histamine antagonist, has been demonstrated to reduce cognitive symptoms in AD. ${ }^{69}$ Peginterferon alfa-2b is a recombinant interferon, which is used in the treatment of hepatitis B and C , genital warts, and some cancers. Peginterferon alfa- $2 b$ has been reported to bind to and activate human type 1 interferon receptors. Such a procedure activates the JAK/STAT (Janus Kinase/Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription) pathway, which has been suggested as a potential target for AD. ${ }^{70,71}$ Apomorphine, a dopamine receptor agonist for Parkinson's disease, has been shown to protect against oxidative stress, which plays a role in AD pathology ${ }^{72}$ and improve memory function in AD. ${ }^{73,74}$ Enoxacin, a fluoroquinolone used to treat bacterial infections, has been suggested to potentially decrease the risk of developing AD when used appropriately with other antibiotics, such as macrolides and fluoroquinolones. ${ }^{77}$\n\n## DISCUSSIONS\n\nIn this study, we built a comprehensive BKG called iBKH, through collecting, cleaning and normalizing raw data from diverse information sources. To date, iBKH has incorporated biomedical knowledge from 18 diverse information sources. In addition to the entity types that are popular in existing BKGs, such as genes, diseases, drugs, pathways, etc., iBKH also involves other complementary sources such as iDISK, ${ }^{40}$ the supplement knowledge base we curated recently. We have made iBKH publicly available in both tabular format as CSV files for sophisticated users who can work with these source files, as well as Neo4j based on which we developed a web-based graphical portal to allow user-friendly knowledge retrieval and exploration. We would continuously enrich the content of iBKH and improve its graphical user interface (GUI) in the future.\n\nIn addition, we have also implemented a graph inference engine based on DGL-KE (Deep Graph Library Knowledge Embedding) ${ }^{26}$ in iBKH to facilitate novel biomedical knowledge discovery. As a proof of concept, we demonstrated the application of iBKH for in-silico hypothesis generation for AD drug repurposing. We observed good quantitative performance of iBKH on drugs that have already been approved and on clinical trial for treating AD. We have also identified novel potentially repurposable drugs for AD with evidence"

It is worthy of mentioning that iBKH can be flexibly extended to drug repurposing for other diseases, as well as predicting other types of biomedical relations, such as prioritizing risk genes of disease (gene-disease relation prediction), predicting candidate target protein for drugs (druggene relation prediction), identifying potential drug-drug interactions (drug-drug relation prediction), etc.\n\n# Limitations of the study \n\nOur iBKH has a few limitations. First, the procedures of constructing and curating iBKH rely on extensive efforts of raw data file extraction and pre-processing, data annotation, as well as terminology normalization, which is not error free. To maximally reduce the probability of error in iBKH, we leveraged the wellcurated biomedical vocabularies such as the unified medical language system (UMLS) to facilitate entity term normalization and conducted multiple rounds of manual review based on random sampling with replacement. In addition, we will also conduct graph learning-based knowledge graph refinement/ completion to address this issue. ${ }^{78}$\n\nSecond, although iBKH has collected and integrated data from diverse sources, the information contained therein can still be incomplete due to the volume and speed of the new biomedical knowledge that has been generated day by day. In this context, efforts on deriving knowledge from biomedical literature ${ }^{79-83}$ or real-world data such as the EHR (electronic health records) ${ }^{9,80}$ would be critical. Moreover, we will make curating and adding new information into iBKH a continuous effort.\n\nThird, like many existing BKGs, iBKH mainly focused on the general biomedical knowledge, which means it may lack fine-grained knowledge for studying particular diseases. On this aspect, there has been research"

      "markdown": "# Materials availability \n\n- The harmonized entity and relation source files for iBKH in CSV format are publicly available online at https://github.com/wcm-wanglab/iBKH.\n- The iBKH online portal is publicly available at http://ibkh.ai/.\n\nThe deployed version of iBKH excluded data from KEGG, as it forbids data redistribution.\n\n## Data and code availability\n\n- This paper integrates publicly available biomedical knowledge bases. These accession URLs for the knowledge bases are listed in the key resources table.\n- The computer codes for iBKH construction and iBKH-based knowledge discovery are publicly available online at https://github.com/wcm-wanglab/iBKH.\n- Any additional information required to reanalyze the data reported in this paper is available from the lead contact upon request.\n\n\n## METHOD DETAILS\n\n## Overview\n\nOur ultimate goal was to build a BKG via comprehensively incorporating biomedical knowledge as much as possible. To date, we have collected and integrated 18 publicly available data sources, harmonized and consolidated them into a comprehensive data compendium. Details of the used data sources were listed in Table 1.\n\n## Raw data processing\n\nGiven the data sources, the first step was to pre-process the raw files of them and extract knowledge, including entity information and relation information. Generally, the databases release their raw data files in various formats, such as CSV, tab-separated values, TXT, EXCEL tablet, Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), Resource Description Framework, and Web Ontology Language (OWL). To address this, for each database, we parsed the raw files and extracted structured data, i.e., the descriptive files for each type of biomedical entity and the files of each type of relation. Such procedure varies by databases or even by files within the same database.\n\n## Term harmonization\n\nTo integrate data from diverse sources, there is a need for harmonizing the entity terms. To achieve this, we utilized a greedy strategy. For a specific entity type, we first chose a database to initialize the entity vocabulary. Next, we built a linkage pool, containing multiple identifiers of the given entity type, to map and integrate entities from all databases to improve the entity vocabulary one by one. The process of constructing the linkage pool for each entity type primarily depended on two procedures: 1) The term dictionary of existing sources was utilized. For example, Disease Ontology ${ }^{59}$ provides Disease Ontology ID, Medical Subject Heading (Medical Subject Headings (MeSH)) ID, UMLS ${ }^{67}$ Concept Unique Identifier (CUI) for each disease entity. 2) The UMLS Application Program Interfaces served as the bridge for term normalization for terms that could not be mapped with the existing term dictionary. To ensure data quality, synonyms were obtained for each term with strict term types such as \"preferred\" and \"abbreviation.\" Finally, multiple rounds of manual quality checks were conducted.\n\nFor gene entity type, we used the HGNC gene repository ${ }^{41}$ as the initial vocabulary of gene entities, as it defines a standard nomenclature for human the genes. The linkage pool for normalization included HGNC IDs, HGNC symbols, and National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) IDs.\n\nFor drug entity type, we initialized our vocabulary using DrugBank ${ }^{53}$ as it provides the up-to-date list of approved drugs and investigational drugs under clinical trials. The linkage pool for drug entity normalization included DrubBank IDs, MeSH terms, MeSH term IDs, UMLS ${ }^{67}$ Concept Unique Identifiers (CUIs), and the drug names in UMLS."

      "markdown": "For molecule entity type, we used the ChEMBL, ${ }^{42}$ a manually curated database of molecules with drug properties, for initializing the vocabulary. The linkage pool for the molecule entities normalization included ChEMBL IDs and International Chemical Identifier (InChi).\n\nFor Side-Effect entity type, we collected the side-effect entities from the SIDER ${ }^{37}$ and described them by using the UMLS CUIs.\n\nFor disease entity type, we used the Disease Ontology ${ }^{29}$ for initializing the vocabulary, as it is a structured database of diseases based on etiological classification. The linkage pool we used for the disease entity normalization included Disease Ontology IDs, MeSH terms, MeSH term IDs, UMLS CUIs, and the disease names in UMLS.\n\nFor symptom entity type, we collected the symptom entities from the Hetionet ${ }^{4}$ and iDISK, ${ }^{40}$ and described them by using the MeSH term and MeSH term ID. We used UMLS CUI as the linkage for symptom entities normalization.\n\nFor Pathway entity type, we used the Reactome, ${ }^{36}$ a manually curated and peer-reviewed pathway database, for initializing the vocabulary. The linkage pool for the pathway entities normalization contained the Reactome IDs, Gene Ontology IDs, and KEGG IDs.\n\nFor anatomy entity type, we used the Uberon ${ }^{30}$ for initializing the vocabulary, as it is a cross-species anatomical ontology based on traditional anatomical classification. The linkage pool for the anatomy entities harmonization included Uberon IDs, MeSH terms, MeSH term IDs, UMLS CUIs, and the anatomy names in UMLS.\n\nFor DSI, DSP, and TC entities, data were collected from our previous curated iDISK. ${ }^{40}$ We used iDISK concept IDs and UMLS CUIs (for TCs) to describe them.\n\n## Knowledge integration\n\nAfter the above normalization procedures, we obtained a CSV file for each entity type, storing all normalized entity terms of the specific entity type followed by their synonyms and detailed descriptions. We were then able to integrate knowledge extracted from different knowledge bases to build iBKH. Specifically, in a BKG, a basic knowledge unit is a triplet, typically defined as <head entity, relation, tail entity>, which indicates that there exists a relation from the head entity to the tail entity in iBKH. Of note, for each pair of head entity and tail entity, there can be multiple types of relations. For instance, we stored \"targets\", \"Transporter\", \"Enzyme\", \"Carrier\", \"downregulates\", \"upregulates\", \"associates\", \"binds\", \"interacts\", and \"text_semantic\" relations between drugs and genes. We also stored the data source information, indicating from which data source(s) we acquired the specific triplet.\n\n## Integrative biomedical knowledge Hub deployment with Neo4j\n\nWe deployed our curated BKG, i.e., the iBKH, using Neo4j (https://neo4j.com), a well-designed graph database platform that allows structured queries in a grap. Specifically, Neo4j can take the CSV files of entities and relations we generated above as input and automatically created a KG instance. In this way, the iBKH can be updated efficiently and flexibly.\n\n## Graphical portal for fast knowledge retrieval\n\nWe developed a web-based graphical portal, which allows the users to design graph query paths visually and flexibly and translates them into Cypher queries (query language provided by Neo4j) automatically in the back end. Specifically, we built the back end (i.e., the server side) using Django (https://www. djangoproject.com/), a high-level Python-based web framework. The iBKH, stored in Neo4j, was linked to the back end. The front end (i.e., the web application side) was built based on HyperText Markup Language Version 5 (HTML5), and Cascading Style Sheets. JavaScript-based software, the neovis (https:// github.com/neo4j-contrib/neovis.js/) and D3.js (https://d3js.org/), were used for graph visualization and data exploration and visualization, respectively."

      "markdown": "# iBKH-based knowledge discovery \n\n(A) Machine learning pipeline for knowledge discovery in the iBKH. We developed a machine learning pipeline for knowledge discovery in the iBKH, which contains two steps as follows.\n\nStep 1, KGE learning. The goal of KGE is to learn embeddings, i.e., meaningful and machine-readable vector-based representations for entities and/or relations in iBKH, while preserve the graph structure. ${ }^{19,49,88}$ In biomedicine, the learned embeddings (i.e., vector representations) of biomedical entities and relations can be used in accelerating diverse down-stream research tasks, such as drug implication discovery, ${ }^{1,7,21,99}$ multi-omics data analysis, ${ }^{7,2}$ clinical data (e.g., electronic healthcare record) analysis, ${ }^{3,45}$ and knowledge extraction from biomedical literature. ${ }^{83}$ In this work, we used the Deep Graph Library - Knowledge Embedding (DGL-KE) (https://github.com/awalabs/dgl-ke), ${ }^{36}$ a Python-based implementation for the advanced KGE algorithms, such as TransE, ${ }^{58}$ TransR, ${ }^{51}$ ComplEx, ${ }^{52}$ and DistMult. ${ }^{53}$ Using the advanced multi-processing and multi-GPU (graphics processor unit) techniques, the DGL-KE accelerates the learning procedures in large-scale graphs like iBKH.\n\nStep 2, link prediction. The task can be formulated as predicting the probability that an unobserved triplet $\\langle h, r, t\\rangle$ exists in the iBKH, where $h$ and $t$ are the head and tail entities, and $r$ is the potential relation, respectively. Specifically, we defined a possibility score of a candidate triplet $\\langle h, r, t\\rangle$ as $P S(<h, r$, $t>)=$ sigmoid $(f(h, r, t))$. The sigmoid function is defined as sigmoid $(a)=1 /(1+\\exp (-a)) . f(\\cdot)$ is the score function of the KGE algorithm we used to calculate the embedding vectors.\n\n- TransE, $f(h, r, t)=-\\|h+r-t\\|_{p}$, where $h, r, t$ are the embedding vectors of $h, r, t$, respectively.\n- TransR, $f(h, r, t)=-\\|\\mathbf{M}, \\mathbf{h}+\\boldsymbol{r}-\\mathbf{M}, \\mathbf{t}\\|_{p}^{2}$, where $\\mathbf{M}_{t}$ is a projection matrix for each relation $r$ that project entities $h$ and $t$ to semantic space of the relation.\n- ComplEx, $f(h, r, t)=<R e(\\boldsymbol{h}), R e(\\boldsymbol{r}), R e(\\mathbf{t})>+<\\operatorname{Im}(\\boldsymbol{h}), \\operatorname{Im}(\\boldsymbol{r}), \\operatorname{Im}(\\mathbf{t})>+<R e(\\boldsymbol{h}), \\operatorname{Im}(\\boldsymbol{r}), \\operatorname{Im}(\\mathbf{t})>-<$ $\\operatorname{Im}(\\boldsymbol{h}), \\operatorname{Im}(\\boldsymbol{r}), \\operatorname{Re}(\\mathbf{t})>$, where $\\operatorname{Re}(\\boldsymbol{x})$ and $\\operatorname{Im}(\\boldsymbol{x})$ are the real and imaginary parts of the complex valued vector $\\boldsymbol{x}$, respectively.\n- DistMult, $f(h, r, t)=h^{T} \\mathbf{W}, \\mathbf{t}^{T}$, where $\\mathbf{W}_{t}$ is relation matrix, which is restricted to a diagonal matrix.\n\nSummarized details of the KGE algorithms can be found elsewhere (https://dglke.dgl.ai/doc/kg.html)\n(B) In-silico hypothesis generation for Alzheimer's disease drug repurposing. As a proof of concept, we performed in-silico hypothesis generation for Alzheimer's disease (AD) drug repurposing, which is to predict potential drug entities that can be linked to the AD entity with a 'treats' relation in the iBKH. To this end, we first downloaded all Food and Drug Administration approved drugs and drugs in clinical trials (Phases I-IV) for AD from the DrugBank (https://go.drugbank.com/), constructing the grand truth drug list. Specifically, we obtained a total of 10 FDA-approved drugs, 30 drugs in Phase IV trials, 43 drugs in Phase III trials, 95 drugs in Phase II trials, and 47 drugs in Phase I trials for AD treatment. Next, to avoid information leaking in prediction, all relations between the AD entity and any drug in the grand truth drug list in the iBKH were removed. Then, entity and relation embedding vectors were calculated using the KGE algorithms. After that, we calculated possibility scores for potential all $\\left\\langle e_{d}, r, e_{A D}\\right\\rangle$ triplets, where $e_{d}$ indicates any drug entity, $e_{A D}$ indicates the $A D$ entity, and $r$ indicates a relation between them. The drugs were ranked based on the possibility scores. In this study, we calculated the possibility scores based on four KGE algorithms, i.e., TransE. ${ }^{50}$ TransR, ${ }^{51}$ ComplEx, ${ }^{52}$ and DistMult. ${ }^{53}$ To enhance prediction, we also proposed an ensemble model. Specifically, the rank of drug $e_{d}$ in the ensemble model was defined as $P S^{\\text {ensemble }}\\left(\\left\\langle e_{d}, r, e_{A D}\\right\\rangle\\right)=\\sum_{i}\\left(N^{D r}-R a n k^{\\prime}\\left(\\left\\langle e_{d}, r, e_{A D}\\right\\rangle\\right)\\right)$ where $i$ indicates the $i$-th KGE algorithm and $N^{D r}$ indicates total number of drugs in iBKH .\n\nTo evaluate prediction performance, we compared the top $K$ ranked drugs with the ground truth drugs. By sliding the value of $K$, we were able to produce the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) and the area under ROC (AUC) score.\n\nFinally, we re-trained the KGE models without removing known relations between AD and drug entities and used the embeddings to predict novel repurposable drug candidates for AD treatment.

Higher values of Hit@k and MRR and a lower value of MR indicate good performance, and vice versa.\n\nAfter that, we re-trained KGE algorithms using all triplets in iBKH.\n\n## Evaluation of AD drug repurposing performance\n\nTo evaluate performance of AD drug repurposing, we used FDA-approved drugs as ground truth and produce the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) and the area under ROC (AUC) score."
