Thus, elucidating neurobiological substrates of relapse risk is fundamental for the development of novel targeted interventions that could promote long-lasting abstinence. In the present study, we analysed restingstate functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) data from a sample of recently detoxified patients with AD ( $n=93$ ) who were followed up for 12 months after rsfMRI assessment. Specifically, we employed graph theoretic analyses to compare functional brain network topology and functional connectivity between future relapsers (REL, $n=59$ ), future abstainers (ABS, $n=28$ ) and age- and gender-matched controls (CON, $n=83$ ). Our results suggest increased whole-brain network segregation, decreased global network integration and overall blunted connectivity strength in REL compared with CON. Conversely, we found evidence for a comparable network architecture in ABS relative to CON. At the nodal level, REL exhibited decreased integration and decoupling between multiple brain systems compared with CON, encompassing regions associated with higher-order executive functions, sensory and reward processing. Among patients with AD, increased coupling between nodes implicated in reward valuation and salience attribution constitutes a particular risk factor for future relapse. Importantly, aberrant network organization in REL was consistently associated with shorter abstinence duration during follow-up, portending to a putative neural signature of relapse risk in AD. Future research should further evaluate the potential diagnostic value of the identified changes in network topology and functional connectivity for relapse prediction at the individual subject level.\n\n\n## KEYWORDS\n\nalcohol dependence, alcohol use disorder, alcoholism, connectomics, functional connectivity, graph theory, relapse, resting-state fMRI\n\n\n[^0]:    ${ }^{1}$ Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy CCM, Charité - Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Corporate Member of Freie Universität Berlin, Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin and Berlin Institute of Health, Berlin, Germany\n    ${ }^{2}$ Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, Technische Universität Dresden, Dresden, Germany\n    ${ }^{3}$ Collaborative Research Centre (SFB 940) \"Volition and Cognitive Control\", Technische Universität Dresden, Dresden, Germany\n    ${ }^{4}$ Department of Addiction Medicine and Psychotherapy, kbo-Isar-Amper-Klinikum München-Ost, Haar, Germany\n    ${ }^{5}$ Department of Biomedical Engineering, Faculty of Medicine, McConnell Brain Imaging Centre (BIC), Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI), McGill University, Montreal, Canada\n    ${ }^{6}$ Mila - Quebec Artificial Intelligence Institute, Montreal, Canada\n\n    Correspondence\n    Justin Böhmer, Research Division of Mind and Brain, Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy CCM, Charité Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Charitéplatz 1, 10117 Berlin, Germany.

Importantly, decreased rsFC within each functional network predicted subsequent time to relapse during a 4-month follow-up period. ${ }^{10}$ However, these previous studies either investigated alterations of predefined largescale functional brain networks ${ }^{10}$ or employed seed-based approaches to probe deviations in rsFC associated with relapse in AD, ${ }^{11-14}$ limiting findings to a narrow set of seed regions and network definitions.\n\nGraph theory, in turn, provides a data-driven approach to characterize the topological organization of functional brain networks. ${ }^{15}$ At the level of the whole brain, network segregation and network integration delineate two fundamental concepts in functional connectomics that provide insights into specialized information processing within subgroups of interconnected brain regions (segregation) and the efficiency of information propagation across the brain (integration). ${ }^{16}$ At the level of individual brain regions, centrality metrics indicate the differential importance of single nodes for the entire network. ${ }^{16}$ Previous research investigating brain network topology in AD using graph theory revealed increased global clustering, ${ }^{17}$ decreased global efficiency, ${ }^{18}$ reduced average functional connectivity and fragmentation of functional modules ${ }^{19}$ in alcohol-dependent patients compared with healthy controls, indicating more segregated and less integrated global network topology in AD with overall decreased connectivity strength. Probing brain-behaviour relationships, Sjoerds et al. found that reduced global clustering, reduced global efficiency and reduced network degree were associated with longer and more severe AD. ${ }^{20}$ However, research on the topological features of rsFC networks associated with relapse risk in AD is scarce. One study investigated the impact of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) on brain network topology in alcohol use disorder (AUD) and its association to relapse. ${ }^{21}$ Specifically, patients with AUD\nunderwent tDCS over the bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex for five consecutive days and participated in rsfMRI sessions before and after the intervention. Afterwards, they were followed up for 90 days to assess alcohol relapse. Global efficiency significantly increased from baseline to post-tDCS, while global clustering decreased. Importantly, increased global efficiency predicted reduced likelihood of early relapse during follow-up while decreased global clustering was associated with reduced impulsivity, ${ }^{21}$ highlighting aberrant network segregation and network integration as a potential marker for relapse risk in alcohol-dependent individuals.\n\nIn the present study, we therefore investigated the resting-state functional brain network architecture in a sample of recently detoxified alcohol-dependent patients who were followed up for 12 months using graph theory. Specifically, we compared measures of wholebrain network organization (network strength, network segregation, network integration), local network organization (nodal centrality) and inter-regional functional connectivity (Network-Based Statistics, NBS ${ }^{22}$ ) between future relapsers (REL), future abstainers (ABS) and controls (CON) to determine topological network characteristics associated with relapse risk in AD. At the whole-brain level, we hypothesized that particularly REL would display increased network segregation, decreased network integration and overall decreased connectivity strength as compared with CON. At the level of individual nodes, we expected decreased centrality and functional connectivity of brain regions and networks previously implicated in relapse, including regions associated with higher-order executive control functions, reward processing, sensory processing and negative emotionality. ${ }^{10-13}$ Conversely, we expected comparable network organizations in ABS and CON, as previous work suggests. ${ }^{23}$ Finally, we assumed that putative disruptions in network topology and functional connectivity in REL would relate to abstinence duration during follow-up, suggesting a potential neural substrate of relapse risk in AD.\n\n## 2 | METHODS\n\n### 2.1 | Participants\n\nAll subjects were recruited as part of a large, bicentric study conducted in Berlin and Dresden investigating predictors for the development and maintenance of alcoholism (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01679145). Data of this study has been reported in previous work addressing different research questions. ${ }^{24-26}$ In total, 222 subjects enrolled in this study. After quality control, 177 subjects with valid behavioural and imaging data were included in the present sample. Ninety-three patients aged 18 to 65 years with AD for at least three years according to ICD-10 and DSM-IV-TR criteria ( $M=11.62$ years according to DSM-IV-TR, $S D=10.05$ ) were"

Additionally, 84 age- and gender-matched controls with social drinking behaviour were included in the study as a control group. Patients were excluded if they reported a current or past substance use disorder except for alcohol and nicotine, other major psychiatric disorders or neurological disorders. At the time of the study, patients were free of any psychotropic medication or drug known to interact with the central nervous system for at least four half-lives post last intake (including illegal drugs and detoxification treatment) as tested by drug urine tests and displayed no relevant alcohol withdrawal symptoms (CIWA-Ar score < 4 $4^{27}$ ). For relapse assessment, patients with AD were continuously followed up for 12 months (48 weeks) after the MRI measurement using the Timeline-Follow-Back (TLFB ${ }^{28}$ ), a reliable method to retrospectively assess alcohol use. ${ }^{29}$ Particularly, subjects were a) contacted via telephone $6,10,18$ and 36 weeks after the last occasion of alcohol use and b) assessed in person 4, 8, 12, 24 and 48 weeks after the last drinking occasion. Follow-up assessments were completed by 87 patients with AD ( $93.5 \\%$ ). Relapse was defined as one drinking occasion during the follow-up interval with at least 60 g or 48 g of alcohol intake for male and female subjects, respectively. Moreover, phosphatidylethanol (PEth) levels determined from dried blood spots of venous blood (threshold: $112 \\mathrm{ng} / \\mathrm{ml}^{30}$ ) collected at 12 and 24 weeks of follow-up were used to validate self-reported instances of alcohol use. Of note, patients did not receive a specific therapeutic intervention to prevent alcohol relapse. During the follow-up period, however, patients were given the opportunity to elaborate on the potential relapse situation and discuss their abstinence motivation and could take part in individual interventions such as support groups. Finally, our sample consisted of 59 relapsers (REL) and 28 abstainers (ABS), see Table 1. The study was carried out in line with the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the medical ethics committees of the Charité - Universitätsmedizin Berlin and Technische Universität Dresden. All subjects provided informed written consent prior to study participation.\n\n## 2.2 | Clinical and psychometric assessment\n\nFor diagnosis and assessment of individual drinking behaviour, we used the computerized version of the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI ${ }^{31,32}$ ). AD severity was assessed using the Alcohol Dependence Scale (ADS ${ }^{33}$ ). Moreover, we implemented the Obsessive Compulsive Drinking Scale (OCDS ${ }^{34}$ ) to measure alcohol craving and we recorded the number of days of abstinence before MRI assessment. For REL, we also assessed the number of days between the MRI measurement and the first relapse using the TLFB.\n\n## 2.3 | Image acquisition\n\nAll images were acquired on two 3T Siemens Magnetom Tim Trio MRI scanners in Berlin and Dresden with a 12-channel phased-array head coil (Siemens Healthineers, Erlangen, Germany), respectively. For each\nparticipant, 148 functional images were acquired during resting-state using a gradient-echo echo-planar imaging (GE-EPI) sequence (TR $=2,410 \\mathrm{~ms}, \\mathrm{TE}=25 \\mathrm{~ms}, 80^{\\circ}$ flip angle, 42 axial [ax > cor] slices with 1 mm slice gap, 2 mm slice thickness, FOV $=192 \\times 192 \\mathrm{~mm}^{2}$, $3 \\times 3 \\mathrm{~mm}^{2}$ in-plane resolution, bandwidth $=2,112 \\mathrm{~Hz} / \\mathrm{Px}$ ). During data acquisition, participants were asked to lie as still as possible while keeping their eyes closed without thinking of anything specific or falling asleep. Additionally, high-resolution T1-weighted 3D structural images (MPRAGE, TR $=1900 \\mathrm{~ms}, \\mathrm{TE}=2.52 \\mathrm{~ms}, 9^{\\circ}$ flip angle, isotropic voxel size of $1 \\times 1 \\times 1 \\mathrm{~mm}^{3}$, bandwidth $=170 \\mathrm{~Hz} / \\mathrm{Px}$ ) and a B0-field map ( $T R=488 \\mathrm{~ms}, \\mathrm{TE}=5.32 \\mathrm{~ms}, 60^{\\circ}$ flip angle, isotropic voxel size of $3 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\mathrm{~mm}^{3}$, bandwidth $=260 \\mathrm{~Hz} / \\mathrm{Px}$ ) were acquired.\n\n## 2.4 | Data preprocessing\n\nData preprocessing was performed using FSL v5.0, ${ }^{35}$ including motion correction, acquisition delay correction, non-brain tissue removal, spatial low-pass filtering with an isotropic gaussian kernel of 6 mm FWHM, denoising using ICA-based artefact removal (ICA-AROMA ${ }^{36}$ ), high-pass filtering of the time series with a cut-off frequency of 0.008 Hz , co-registration of resting-state volumes to the T1 image using boundary-based registration with a field map-based correction of spatial distortions due to local field inhomogeneity, non-linear normalization of the T1 image to the 2 mm MNI standard space template (Montreal Neurological Institute, Quebec, Canada) using Advanced Normalization Tools (ANTs ${ }^{37}$ ), spatial transformation of resting-state data to MNI standard space applying the registration matrices and warp images from the two previous registration steps, and resampling of resting-state data into 3 mm isotropic voxels. Participants with excessive head movements after head motion correction (i.e., mean framewise displacement $>0.5 \\mathrm{~mm}$ ) were excluded $(n=7)$.\n\n## 2.5 | Network construction\n\n### 2.5.1 | Node definition\n\nNodes were obtained by dividing the brain into anatomically distinct regions of interest (ROI) based on the Brainnetome Atlas ${ }^{38}$ resulting in a network of 246 nodes ( 210 cortical and 36 subcortical nodes). Each node's time series was calculated as the mean of the time series from all voxels belonging to the respective node.\n\n### 2.5.2 | Edge definition\n\nWe estimated functional connectivity between nodes using L2-regularized partial correlation (regularization parameter rho $=0.01$ ), calculated via the inverse of the covariance matrix. This resulted in a $246 \\times 246$ rsFC matrix for each participant. Partial correlation determines the correlation between two node's time series while conditioning on the time series from all other nodes in the"

Thresholding can introduce network fragmentation, that is, splitting up the network into disconnected components where at least one node is not connected to any other node in the network, thereby confounding the computation of network topological parameters. In our study, we assessed network fragmentation for all subjects and thresholds using the function CheckFrag.m implemented in GraphVar 2.0. ${ }^{43,44}$\n\nThe topological properties of the undirected weighted network were calculated for each threshold, including global measures on network segregation (global clustering coefficient $C_{\\text {global }}$, global transitivity $T_{\\text {global }}$ ), network integration (global efficiency $E_{\\text {global }}$, global characteristic path length $L_{\\text {global }}$ ) and global connectivity strength $W_{\\text {global }}$. At the nodal level, we evaluated the topological centrality of each node as an indicator for its influence on the network. To this end, we calculated four different measures of nodal centrality, including nodal degree centrality $D_{\\text {nodal }}$, nodal strength centrality $W_{\\text {nodal }}$, nodal eigenvector centrality $E C_{\\text {nodal }}$ and nodal betweenness centrality"

      "markdown": "$B C_{\\text {nodal }}$. A detailed description of the global and nodal graph measures analysed in this study can be found in Table S1. Prior to the computation of graph topological metrics (except for $W_{\\text {global }}$ ), we scaled subject-level rsFC matrices by the maximum absolute weight to obviate confounds in network topology introduced through potential differences in weight distributions. To improve interpretability, subjectlevel graph metrics were additionally normalized by dividing the respective measure of the original network by the average of the same measure derived from 100 random networks with the same number of nodes and similar degree, weight and strength distributions (see function null_model_und_sign.m from Brain Connectivity Toolbox Version 2019-03-0315; available at https://sites.google.com/ site/bctnet/all-functions). For each normalized global and nodal graph measure, we computed the area under the curve (AUC) as an integrated score independent of a single threshold selection. Network analyses were performed using GraphVar 2.043,44 running under the MATLAB ${ }^{\\circledR}$ environment.\n\n## 2.7 | Statistical analysis\n\n### 2.7.1 | Group differences in global and local network topology\n\nGroup comparisons of global and nodal graph metrics between AD subgroups (REL, ABS) and CON were carried out using nonparametric permutation tests controlling for age, gender, site and education years. First, we computed the one-way ANOVA $F$-value testing for differences in the AUC of a given graph metric between groups. Next, we randomly shuffled the group labels between participants and re-calculated the $F$-value. We repeated this procedure 10000 times to create an empirical null distribution of the effect underlying group differences in AUC. Finally, we obtained a $p$-value by estimating the proportion of permutations that were equal to or exceeded the empirical $F$-value. Results were considered significant if actual effects exceeded those from the empirical null distribution according to the $p<0.05$ threshold. Global and nodal graph measures exhibiting significant group differences were further subjected to post-hoc analysis. Specifically, we computed the empirical differences in AUC between groups using two-sample $t$-tests, then permuted the group labels 10000 times, re-calculated the $t$-test and estimated the proportion of effects in the permutation-based null distribution that exceeded the empirical group effect. Results were considered significant if $p<0.05$. A false discovery rate (FDR) correction accounting for multiple testing was implemented for global and nodal metrics separately. For global metrics, we accounted for the number of global parameters and post-hoc group comparisons $(n=15)$ while for nodal metrics, we corrected for the number of parameters $(n=246)$ for each graph metric. To assess evidence for the null hypothesis, we also calculated the Bayes factor for each group contrast based on $t$-tests with a JZS prior $(r=\\sqrt{ } 2 / 2)$ using the BayesFactor package in $\\mathbb{R}^{45}$ and scaled the corresponding values using a $\\log 10$ transform.\n\n### 2.7.2 | Group differences in functional connectivity\n\nWe applied the Network-Based Statistic (NBS) approach22 to the fully connected partial correlation matrices to identify differences in rsFC between groups. Briefly, significantly altered subnetworks, defined in terms of connected graph components, were determined by incorporating an edge-by-edge comparison of rsFC based on a one-way ANOVA with $F>4.8(p<0.01)$. Within the identified subnetworks, post-hoc twosample $t$-tests were conducted to detect significantly altered components between specific groups. In our study, we used an initial link threshold of $t_{\\text {initial }}=3.1$ to identify suprathreshold links. Since NBS highly depends on the initial cluster-defining threshold, we additionally tested a range of different link thresholds ( $t_{\\text {initial }}=2.9-3.3$ ). To estimate the significance of the identified components, we generated an empirical null distribution of maximal component sizes by randomly permuting the group assignments 10,000 times and calculating the proportion of permutations in which the maximal component size exceeded the size of the observed component. Components (i.e., subnetworks) were considered significant if $p<0.05$, FWE-corrected.\n\n### 2.7.3 | Brain-behaviour relationships\n\nTo investigate associations between putative alterations in network topological parameters and clinical variables, we used partial correlation controlling for age, gender, site and education years. In case of non-normality of clinical and graph topological variables as determined by Shapiro-Wilk tests ( $p<0.05$ ), we computed Spearman's partial rank correlation. FDR correction determined over the number of significantly altered network metrics was applied to account for multiple testing.\n\nAdditionally, we performed survival analyses to incorporate patients with AD with censored relapse data. Specifically, we calculated Cox proportional hazards models to examine the association between altered network topological measures and time to relapse. For sensitivity analyses, the statistical models were adjusted for age, gender, site and years of education. The proportional hazards assumption was tested based on scaled Schoenfeld residuals. Network parameters and covariates were z-standardized to facilitate interpretability and comparability of hazard ratios (HR). To account for multiple testing, FDR correction was applied. Survival analyses were carried out using IBM SPSS for Windows 27.0 (IBM Corp, Armonk, NY, USA).\n\n## 3 | RESULTS\n\n### 3.1 | Sample characteristics\n\nOne subject was excluded from further analyses because of severe network fragmentation.

As expected, both AD subgroups reported significantly more alcohol consumption (per day, per drinking occasion and per binge-drinking episode), higher addiction severity (ADS) and higher alcohol craving (OCDS) compared with CON. Interestingly, CON experienced their first binge-drinking episode at an earlier age compared with both patient subgroups. No significant differences could be observed between REL and ABS on any demographic or clinical outcome (Table 1). Finally, no significant differences in head motion were observed between groups $(H[2]=2.75, p=0.253)$.\n\n## 3.2 | Global topology of functional brain networks\n\nREL exhibited decreased $W_{\\text {global }}\\left(p_{\\text {FDR }}=0.042\\right)$, increased $C_{\\text {global }}$ $\\left(p_{\\text {FDR }}=0.004\\right)$, increased $T_{\\text {global }}\\left(p_{\\text {FDR }}=0.004\\right)$, decreased $E_{\\text {global }}$ $\\left(p_{\\text {FDR }}=0.039\\right)$ and increased $L_{\\text {global }}\\left(p_{\\text {FDR }}=0.039\\right)$ compared with CON, suggesting a more segregated and less integrated network topology in REL with overall decreased network strength (Figure 1A). No significant differences were found between ABS and REL as well as between ABS and CON on any graph measure after FDR correction. These findings were consistent when additionally accounting for effects of head motion and for the number of days between withdrawal and fMRI scan (Table S3). Bayes Factor indices based on $t$-tests\ncorroborated results from frequentist analyses. Specifically, we found moderate to strong evidence for differences between REL and CON across all global graph measures, while no such evidence was found for the comparison of REL vs. ABS (Table S2). Moreover, in line with our hypotheses, comparing ABS vs. CON consistently yielded anecdotal or moderate evidence for the null hypothesis across all global graph measures (Table S2).\n\n## 3.3 | Nodal centrality\n\nAt the nodal level, we identified those brain regions that displayed significant group differences based on frequentist analysis ( $p<0.05$, 10000 permutations, FDR-corrected) as well as strong evidence for group differences based on Bayes Factor indices $\\left(B F_{X q(10)}+1\\right)$ for any nodal graph measure.

Specifically, Cox proportional hazards models revealed that global measures of network segregation significantly predicted time to relapse in patients with AD ( $C_{\\text {global }}: \\mathrm{HR}=1.42,95 \\% \\mathrm{CI}=1.15-$ 1.77, $p=0.001 ; T_{\\text {global }}: \\mathrm{HR}=1.42,95 \\% \\mathrm{CI}=1.15-1.77, p=0.001$ ), indicating that higher network segregation increased the probability of relapse by $42 \\%$.

Adjusting the statistical models for age, gender, site and years of education led to a violation of the proportional hazards assumption because of an interaction of the site variable with time. Consequently, we performed stratified Cox proportional hazards models with site as stratification variable. After stratification, all models met the assumption of proportional hazards (Table S5).

Compared with controls (CON), REL displayed disturbances in global and local brain network topology, implicating multiple regions from different brain circuits. Conversely, ABS exhibited a comparable network organization relative to CON. Importantly, topological network characteristics in REL were associated with an earlier relapse after detoxification, portending to a possible neural signature of relapse risk in AD.\n\nExamining the whole-brain global network topology, we observed decreased global functional connectivity strength in REL compared with CON, reminiscent of previous work. ${ }^{10,11}$ Moreover, graph theoretic indices of functional network segregation revealed increased global clustering and global transitivity in REL compared with CON, suggesting more segregated brain networks in future relapsers relative to controls. It has been proposed that network segregation delineates the extent of specialized information processing within clusters of functionally related brain regions. ${ }^{16}$ Elevated segregation, however, results in isolated information processing within subnetworks, thus perturbing the dispersion of information across the network. ${ }^{47}$ Consistent with this view, we found impairments in global functional integration as indicated by increased global characteristic path length and decreased global efficiency in REL, suggesting diminished capacity to efficiently propagate information from distributed brain regions across the network. Together, our findings reveal a tendency for more segregated information processing at the expense of long-range cortical interactions between distributed brain regions, possibly reflecting impairments in cognitive flexibility typical for $\\mathrm{AD}^{48,49}$ that manifest in mental and behavioural rigidity, such as craving and compulsive alcohol use, and contribute to increased relapse risk. ${ }^{50}$ In this regard, we found tentative evidence for an association between increased network segregation and higher levels of self-reported craving. Moreover, aberrant network topological metrics were associated with shorter duration of abstinence during follow-up in both correlational\nand survival analyses. Likewise, Holla et al. demonstrated that changes in global clustering and global efficiency decreased impulsivity and reduced likelihood of early relapse in patients with AUD following tDCS treatment. ${ }^{21}$\n\nSimilar alterations in global network organization have been shown for patients with AD independent of relapse status, ${ }^{17-19}$ although results were not consistent across studies. ${ }^{20}$ The present study extends previous work by highlighting deviations in network topology particularly in future relapsers. Conversely, we did not observe any significant differences in network topology between ABS and CON. In fact, Bayesian analyses consistently indicated more evidence for a comparable network organization in ABS and CON than evidence for different network topologies, giving rise to the conclusion that functional segregation and integration are largely preserved in those patients with AD that prospectively refrain from further alcohol use. Of note, we did not observe any significant differences between REL and ABS with respect to alcohol use patterns, addiction severity or craving, debilitating the ascription of the observed effects to more severely affected individuals. Instead, the identified changes seem to be specific to the relapsing subtype, portending to a possible neural substrate of relapse risk in AD.\n\nAt the level of individual nodes, REL exhibited decreased centrality of several widely distributed regions implicated in multiple brain systems, many of which correlated with shorter abstinence duration after detoxification. In line with our predictions, we found decreased nodal strength centrality in prefrontal brain regions, including the left dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC, BA 9) and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vlPFC, BA 44), two critical neural substrates involved in a variety of higher-order executive functions, including inhibitory control, self-regulation and goal-directed behavioural control. ${ }^{51,52}$ Blunted vlPFC activation ${ }^{53}$ as well as decreased dmPFC connectivity across different cognitive tasks ${ }^{13,54}$ have been linked to relapse in previous work, substantiating the link between decreased regulatory control"

      "markdown": "and relapse in AD. Moreover, NBS analysis revealed decreased rsFC in REL compared with CON between the dmPFC and the precuneus, a core region of the default mode network (DMN55). The DMN plays an important role for internally oriented cognitions, such as selfawareness, episodic memory and reflecting on past and future events. ${ }^{56}$ Decoupling between the DMN (precuneus) and executive control network (dmPFC) has previously been observed in addiction, ${ }^{57}$ reflecting difficulties to disengage from negative emotions and ruminations about alcohol use during withdrawal, ${ }^{58}$ a known risk factor for relapse. ${ }^{59}$\n\nFurthermore, local network analyses revealed decreased centrality in two other core regions of the DMN, namely the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC, BA 2360) and parahippocampal gyrus ( $\\mathrm{PhG}^{61}$ ). Given the DMNs role in self-reflection and memory processes, decreased centrality in PCC and PhG might indicate deficits in relapsers to reflect on past events of alcohol use and their consequences, thus compromising the capacity to adapt future decision-making behaviour accordingly. Consistent with this view, decreased DMN node centrality was associated with earlier relapse after detoxification, extending previous findings of a positive relationship between efficiency in DMN nodes and length of abstinence. ${ }^{6}$ In addition, consistent with our hypotheses, we observed decreased centrality of sensorimotor (BA 1,2,3) and visual network nodes (BA 20, BA 37, lingual gyrus, cuneus) in the whole-brain network. Hypoconnectivity in visual and sensorimotor domains have been related to alcohol-drinking ${ }^{62-64}$ and $\\mathrm{AD}^{9,11}$ in previous studies. Decoupling between these two systems in relation to relapse was also demonstrated in the present study using the NBS approach. Recent work revealed an association between sensorimotor and visual network connectivity with trait impulsivity. ${ }^{65}$ Thus, our findings indicate deficient functioning of brain systems in REL that support the integration of multimodal perceptual information, resulting in compromised sensory awareness that is relevant for decision-making processes, including the decision to inhibit alcohol use urges. ${ }^{11}$\n\nImportantly, relapse to alcohol consumption was associated with decreased centrality in several subcortical brain regions known to be critically involved at different stages of the addiction cycle, including the amygdala, hippocampus, basal ganglia (globus pallidus, putamen) and thalamus. ${ }^{66-68}$ Consistent with our findings, Bordier et al. demonstrated a fragmentation of the basal functional module comprising the amygdala, pallidum, putamen, hippocampus, thalamus, and caudate into smaller subdivision in patients with AD, which still persisted after two weeks of withdrawal treatment, ${ }^{19}$ suggesting a potential risk factor for perpetuated alcohol-seeking. The strongest evidence for decreased centrality in REL was observed in the left putamen, a part of the dorsal striatum, which has been implicated in the transition from voluntary towards compulsive and habitual drug-seeking. ${ }^{69}$ The putamen functionally connects to motor cortices and prefrontal control regions, including the dmPFC and vlPFC. ${ }^{70,71}$ Decreased putamen connectivity in REL might reflect the dysregulation of prefrontal control over the dorsal striatum that may propel motor systems towards habitual alcoholseeking. In this regard, impaired functional connectivity between dorsal striatum and prefrontal regions has been reported in cannabis-dependent individuals at rest ${ }^{72}$ and in patients with AD when making habitual decisions, the latter being associated with shorter abstinence duration. ${ }^{73}$\n\nInterestingly, NBS analysis revealed that REL exhibited increased rsFC relative to ABS in a predominantly right-hemispheric subnetwork encompassing nodes in the ACC (dACC, sgACC), anterior insula, OFC, SPL and thalamus. The dACC and anterior insula delineate core regions of the salience network, guiding attentional resources towards salient events based on interoceptive states, ${ }^{74,75}$ while the sgACC and OFC constitute integral parts of the reward network that is implicated in the appraisal of subjective value. ${ }^{76,77}$ Previous studies demonstrated greater OFC and ACC activation in response to alcohol-related cues in patients with AD, which was associated with alcohol craving and relapse. ${ }^{78-80}$ Similarly, anterior insula function has recently been proposed as a marker for relapse propensity in $\\mathrm{AD}^{81}$ because of its role for craving and drug-seeking. ${ }^{82}$ The thalamus acts as a hub region in the identified subnetwork with functional connections to the reward system nodes (sgACC and OFC) and to the SPL, a brain region also implicated in reward processing ${ }^{83}$ and goal-directed allocation of attentional resources ${ }^{84}$ that gets activated by alcohol cues in dependent drinkers. ${ }^{85}$ Together, our findings indicate that hyperconnectivity between regions implicated in reward processing and salience attribution contributes to relapse risk among patients with AD, possibly reflecting elevated preoccupation and anticipation of reward during the brain's resting state that may propel individuals towards alcoholseeking behaviour and thus facilitate relapse risk. These individuals might particularly benefit from behavioural interventions targeted at the modification of cognitive biases contributing to habitual behaviours. ${ }^{86}$\n\nSome limitations in this study should be considered. Firstly, we obtained a relatively small sample size in the group of AD abstainers. However, high relapse rates constitute a core characteristic of AD, ${ }^{5}$ thus lower sample sizes of abstainers relative to relapsers lie in the nature of the disorder. Nonetheless, future studies should employ larger samples to increase statistical power and further elucidate the link between aberrant network topology and craving. Secondly, subjects were not matched based on socioeconomic status even though previous work highlighted the impact of socioeconomic factors for AD. ${ }^{87}$ However, in our study, we included information on the educational background of individuals as covariates when performing group analyses to control for confounding effects attributable to socioeconomic influences. Thirdly, we did not observe a difference in selfreported craving between future relapsers and abstainers. Potentially, relapsers underreported cravings because of reasons such as denial or social desirability. Future research might therefore incorporate behavioural measures of craving that reflect relapse risk more accurately, such as implicit measures. ${ }^{88}$ Lastly, the diagnostic value of the identified changes in functional network organization for the prediction of relapse at the level of the individual subject remains unknown. ${ }^{89,90}$ Although previous studies demonstrated substantial predictive utility of functional network measures for individual diagnosis and classification of alcohol-dependent individuals, ${ }^{63}$ future research should"

Particularly, on a whole-brain level, relapsers process information rather in a segregated fashion within functionally interconnected regions than distributing information efficiently across the brain. On a local level, relapsers displayed dysfunctional integration and decoupling between multiple brain systems, particularly involving cortical and subcortical brain regions associated with higher-order executive functions, sensory and reward processing. Among patients with AD, hyperconnectivity between brain regions implicated in reward processing and salience attribution seems to constitute a particular risk factor for relapse. Together, our findings provide novel insights into the neurobiological substrates of relapse risk in AD. Future research should further investigate the predictive utility of the identified pattern of functional connectome disorganization for relapse at the single-subject level.\n\n## AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS\n\nAndreas Heinz, Michael N.
