To quickly follow the dynamical Pareto optimal front (POF) of DMOPs, prediction model-based optimization algorithms have been widely studied. However, in most existing prediction-based methods, only the linear relationship of historical solutions is studied, and complex correlations among the decision variables are always ignored. To address this issue, the multi-reservoir ESN (MRESN) based predictor is designed and integrated with the multi-objective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition (MOEA/D), which is called MRESN-MOEA/D in short. The comprehensive relationship among the previous solutions is derived using the MRESN predictor, whose multi-reservoir structure projects the inputs into the complex echo-state space and enhances the information sharing among the decision variables. To overcome the limitation caused by insufficient training solutions, the fractal interpolation technique is implemented before MRESN training. Then, the trained MRESN predictor is applied to produce the original population for the new environment. Finally, MRESN-MOEA/D is applied in both simulated benchmarks and an actual dynamical wastewater treatment system. The experiment results illustrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms other state-of-the-art methods with better convergence and diversity.\n\n## 1. Introduction\n\nIn industrial production and scientific research, there are many multi-objective optimization problems (MOPs), whose objectives conflict with one another [42,43,44]. Many MOPs are not static, i.e., the objective parameters or constraints have uncertainty or dynamics, and these MOPs are called dynamic MOPs (DMOPs) [5,12,41]. For example, in a wastewater treatment process (WWTP), the optimal set-points of dissolved oxygen (DO) and nitrate nitrogen (NO) should be dynamically adjusted according to the constantly changing influent flow rate or weather conditions [8]. Recently, DMOPs have been widely studied in various applications, such as production scheduling [6], face recognition [22], and vehicle route planning [21,25].\n\nIn MOPs, the time-varying characteristics may result in changing Pareto optimal set (POS) and Pareto optimal front (POF). Thus, efficiently and effectively addressing DMOPs remains a big challenge. To follow the changing POS or POF of DMOPs after an environment change occurs, the multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) have been integrated with environmental response\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    * Corresponding author.\n\n    E-mail address: clyang5@bjut.edu.cn (C.
