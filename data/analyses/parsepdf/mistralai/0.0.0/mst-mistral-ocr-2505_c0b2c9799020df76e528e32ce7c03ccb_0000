Overall, little is known about how different CNVs conferring risk for the same condition may affect subcortical brain structures and how these alterations relate to the level of disease risk conferred by CNVs. To fill this gap, we investigated gross volume, and vertex level thickness and surface maps of subcortical structures in 11 different CNVs and 6 different NPDs.\n\nMethods: Subcortical structures were characterized using harmonized ENIGMA protocols in 675 CNV carriers (at the following loci: 1q21.1, TAR, 13q12.12, 15q11.2, 16p11.2, 16p13.11, and 22q11.2) and 782 controls (Male/Female: 727/730; age-range: 6-80 years) as well as ENIGMA summary-statistics for ASD, SZ, ADHD, Obsessive-Compulsive-Disorder, Bipolar-Disorder, and Major-Depression.\n\nResults: Nine of the 11 CNVs affected volume of at least one subcortical structure. The hippocampus and amygdala were affected by five CNVs. Effect sizes of CNVs on subcortical volume, thickness and local surface area were correlated with their previously reported effect sizes on cognition and risk for ASD and SZ. Shape analyses were able to identify subregional alterations that were averaged out in volume analyses. We identified a common latent dimension - characterized by opposing effects on basal ganglia and limbic structures - across CNVs and across NPDs.\n\n## Conclusion:"

We also observed distinct effects with some CNVs clustering with adult conditions while others clustered with ASD. This large cross-CNV and NPDs analysis provide insight into the longstanding questions of why CNVs at different genomic loci increase the risk for the same NPD, as well as why a single CNV increases the risk for a diverse set of NPDs.\n\n# INTRODUCTION \n\nSubcortical brain structures play a critical role in cognitive, affective, and social functions in humans (1, 2). Large-scale international neuroimaging studies have shown that major neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders (NPDs) (3), including schizophrenia (SZ (4)), major-depressive-disorder (MDD (5)), bipolar disorder (BD (6)), obsessive-compulsivedisorder (OCD (7)), autism-spectrum-disorder (ASD (8)), and attention-deficit-hyperactivitydisorder (ADHD (9)) are associated with alterations in subcortical structures (10-12). These case-control association studies have revealed small to moderate effect sizes on brain morphometry which have been interpreted as a consequence of heterogeneity at the level of genetics and brain mechanisms (13-16).\n'Genetics first' studies, in which participants are ascertained based on genetic etiology, can potentially overcome challenges posed by the genetic and mechanistic heterogeneity of behaviorally defined (idiopathic) NPDs (17-19). There is a growing body of literature demonstrating subcortical volumetric alterations associated with genetic risk for NPDs as conferred by copy number variants (CNVs). CNVs are major contributors to NPDs such as ASD and SZ (15, 20), but show weaker associations with BD (21, 22) and MDD (23). Prior studies have shown that CNVs including 1q21.1-distal (24), 16p11.2-proximal BP4-5 (25),"

Recent studies found a significant overlap between subcortical and cortical alterations associated with 22q11.2 deletion carriers, and those associated with idiopathic schizophrenia, as well as other psychiatric illnesses (13, 28).\n\nBeyond volumetric measurements, shape analyses of subcortical structures can capture differences that are predictive of disease status at a higher granularity (2, 29). Studies have typically focused on (13, 30): thickness defined by the distance from the medial axis of each structure, and local surface area which is a measure of surface contraction or expansion. Both shape measures have been shown to be highly heritable $(31,32)$, and have been used to map subcortical variation in SZ (30), ASD (29), MDD (33), and BD (34). Thickness is a proxy for subregional volume changes while the relationship between surface and volume depends on the local curvature of the region (30). For CNVs, subcortical analyses at the vertex level have only been performed in 22q11.2 deletion carriers (13) demonstrating multiple clusters of regional subcortical alterations, which were modulated by psychotic illness.\n\nOverall, little is known about how genetic variants conferring risk for psychiatric conditions affect subcortical structures. Prior neuroimaging studies have each mainly focussed on individual CNVs, making it challenging to directly compare MRI alterations across CNVs as well as relate these MRI alterations to the level of disease risk conferred by CNVs. In particular, while Multiple CNVs confer risk for the same psychiatric conditions $(35,36)$, it is unknown if they are also associated with similar patterns of brain alterations underlay by a common latent dimension. Similarly, it has been shown that a common latent dimension can be identified across psychiatric diagnoses (37) and it is unknown if a similar dimension is observed for genetic risk."

Specifically, we aimed to: i) characterize volumetric and shape subcortical brain alterations in 11 CNVs, ii) relate effect sizes of CNVs on subcortical metrics with previously reported effects of CNVs on risk for NPDs, and iii) identify latent subcortical brain morphometry dimensions across CNVs, and NPDs.\n\nTo this end, we assembled the largest T1-weighted brain MRI dataset across all recurrent CNVs $(\\mathrm{n}=11)$ previously associated with varying levels of risk for psychiatric illness (Table 1), and characterized volume, 3D surface, and thickness maps of subcortical structures. Effect sizes for 6 NPDs (ADHD, ASD, BD, MDD, OCD, and SZ) were obtained from previously published studies from the ENIGMA consortium.\n\n# METHODS \n\nParticipants: Recurrent deletions and duplications were included in the study if 1) the level association between the CNV and psychiatric conditions (or lack thereof) as well as the effect size on cognitive ability was previously established (15, 17, 20, 21, 38-42) and 2) MRI data were available for at least 20 carriers of the same CNV. This minimum sample size of 20 was established based on the power to detect large effect sizes as previously published (14)).\n\nClinically ascertained groups: CNV carriers were recruited after either being referred for genetic testing due to the diagnosis of a neurodevelopmental disorder or as the relative (e.g., parent) of a CNV carrier. Controls within clinically ascertained groups were either noncarriers within the same families.\n\nUnselected population group: CNV carriers were identified in the UK Biobank. Controls were defined as individuals who did not carry any of the 11 CNVs selected from this study."

MRI parameters for each cohort are detailed in the Supplemental-Material.\n\nSubcortical volume and shape segmentation: FreeSurfer 5.3.0 was used to segment all scans into seven bilateral subcortical regions of interest: nucleus-accumbens, amygdala, caudate, hippocampus, putamen, pallidum, and thalamus. The ENIGMA subcortical shape analysis pipeline (30) (http://enigma.ini.usc.edu/protocols/imaging-protocols/) was then applied to derive two measures of shape morphometry for each subcortical region: 1) the radial distance, which is the distance from each vertex to the medial curve of each region (referred to as thickness); 2) the logarithm of the Jacobian determinant (LogJacs), which corresponds to the surface dilation ratio between the subject structure and the template (referred to as surface).

This approach was used for CNVs across ICV, subcortical volumes, and subcortical shape analysis. The FDR procedure (44) was applied within CNVs (11-CNVs by 8-MRI volumes).

All effect sizes were computed after regressing for age, sex, site, and ICV.\n\nFor comparisons across metrics, the following maximum effect sizes were used: absolute Cohen's $d$ for ICV, maximum absolute Cohen's $d$ across 7 subcortical volumes, and average absolute Cohen's $d$ of the top decile across subcortical shape vertices. Because the proportion of significant vertices varied across CNVs and NPDs (due to differences in effect and sample sizes) we chose to focus on the top decile Cohen's $d$ for all CNVs and NPDs to avoid biases and to provide effect sizes comparable across CNVs and NPDs. Vertices in the top decile were identified for thickness and surface separately and were not constrained by spatial continuity.

The CNV-control analyses for 22q11.2 deletions and TAR duplications provided the highest and lowest number of significant vertices, respectively (Table ST4-ST7). For each CNV, the largest number of significant vertices was observed for thickness in caudate, and for surface in thalamus, hippocampus and caudate (Table ST4-ST7). A significant mirror effect at the vertex level was observed between deletions and duplication for only one locus (16p11.2, Figure 4.A). Because surface and thickness showed a positive correlation across most vertices in controls, we presented a simplified map representing concordant effects on surface and thickness (Figure SF7). Vertices with the largest concordant increases were observed in the thalamus for 16p11.2-proximal deletions and head of the caudate for the 22q11.2 deletions.

We observed a significant correlation between the effect size of CNVs on subcortical volumes/thickness/surface and their previously reported effect size on IQ $(3,38,47)(\\mathrm{r}=0.66-$ $0.75, \\mathrm{p}<0.03$ ) as well as risk for either $\\operatorname{ASD}(3,20,48,49)$ or $\\operatorname{SZ}(3,15,49)(\\mathrm{r}=0.69-0.89$, $\\mathrm{p}<0.03$, Figure 2C).

Five clusters were obtained by running K-means clustering using PC1 and PC2, with cluster 3 (green-color) corresponding to adult NPDs, cluster 4 and 5 corresponding to ADHD, and ASD respectively, and cluster 1 and 2 to CNVs. These groupings were reflected in the correlation matrix of Cohen's $d$ profiles (Figure 3A).

Ventral and dorsal regions showed distinct patterns of alterations. Alterations were mostly bilateral except for the thalamus.

For the hippocampus, most vertices with concordant alterations suggested a volume decrease in the body, but focal increases were also observed in the head (PC1) and tail (PC2), (Figure 4E-H, and Table ST9).\n\nComparing PCA results across subcortical metrics shows that structures contributing to the latent dimension for volume are on average also those contributing to latent dimension for surface and thickness (Figure SF13). Lower variance explained for shape analyses suggests that shared Cohen's d profiles may decrease when moving from gross volume to measures with higher granularity (Figure SF14-15).

Analyses at a higher granularity using shape metrics showed that these effects were localized to subregions of the subcortical structures. The effect sizes of CNVs on subcortical structures were correlated with their previously reported effect size on cognition and risk for ASD and SZ. That is, larger and gene-rich CNVs (e.g., 22q11.2 and 16p11.2proximal) - which show higher risk for disease - also showed greater alterations of subcortical structures. Cohen's $d$ for CNVs were larger than those derived from case-control association studies for group of individuals with a psychiatric condition. In line with the pleiotropic effects of CNVs on risk for multiple NPDs, we identified latent dimensions explaining 44.7\\% of the variance in Cohen's $d$ maps across all CNVs and NPDs. Latent dimensions were defined by opposing loadings on basal ganglia and limbic structures.\n\nAll 11 CNVs showed significant effects on subcortical thickness and local surface area and most of them also affected subcortical volume. The largest effects across metrics were observed for 22q11.2 deletions. Hippocampus volume was altered by 5 CNVs, and had the largest number of significant vertices for surface across CNVs. The effect sizes of CNVs on volume, surface and thickness were correlated with the previously reported mean effect size of each CNV on cognition and risk for disease. The same correlation has been reported between effect sizes of CNVs on functional connectivity metrics and cognition / risk for diseases (51). However, there was no relationship between effect sizes on ICV and risk for disease or cognition (14) indicating that the increase in granularity achieved by vertex level shape analysis could improve our understanding of brain-behavior relationships.

As opposed to fitting an average MRI pattern across a cognitive dimension, our alternative genetic first approach provides a much stronger correlation by working with multiple MRI-profiles associated with each genetic variant and their respective behavioral alterations. In other words, this allows one to move from single to multiple modes of brain-behavior associations.\n\nMost of the variance in Cohen's $d$ profiles for subcortical structures was distinct for each CNV. This is consistent with a recent study showing relative specificity of association between CNVs and brain alterations using morphometric similarity mapping of cortical regions (53). On the other hand, the amount of variance explained by PCs ( $\\mathrm{PC} 1=45 \\%$ and $\\mathrm{PC} 2=28 \\%$ ) is similar to those ( $32 \\%$ and $29 \\%$ ) previously published for cortical regions-ofinterest (ROI), cortical thickness and surface area for eight CNVs (54). This presence of shared effects across CNVs, regardless of brain measures analyzed, suggests that similar brain mechanisms might underlie brain alterations across subsets of CNVs.\n\nExtending the principal components analysis (PCA) across CNVs and NPDs identified components similar to the ones described above, defined by opposing loadings on basal ganglia and limbic structures. Basal ganglia and limbic structures were previously identified as structures delineating different SZ subtypes using data driven approaches (34). These shared Cohen's $d$ profiles may explain some of the pleiotropic effects of CNVs (i.e. why all NPD CNVs increase risk for either ASD or SZ, or for both conditions). Subcortical structures with top PC loading include basal ganglia structures known to be primarily involved in motor control (55), as well as limbic structures involved in higher order functions including motivation, emotion, learning, and memory, reflecting a unimodal to transmodal axis (56).

CNVs showed either little or even negative correlations with NPDs. The latter tend to cluster among themselves, except for ASD and ADHD (37). For example, 16p11.2 duplications -which increase risk for SZ and ASD- showed effects on subcortical shapes that were negatively correlated with those observed for idiopathic ASD. This could suggest that within a group of individuals with the same psychiatric diagnosis, some may show opposing MRI alterations. In addition, while effect size of CNVs on subcortical structures were correlated to risk, there was no concordance between the level of ASD- or SZ-risk conferred by CNVs and the similarity between their subcortical profiles. This highlights again, multiple modes of brainbehavior association underlying the heterogeneity of brain patterns associated with a psychiatric condition.\n\nWhile some structures showed no significant differences at the gross volume level, shape analyses of the same structures revealed regions of lower as well as greater surface and thickness. For example, while the volume of the caudate has small loading on PCs, subregions of the caudate were top contributors to PCs of shape metrics. This finding highlights the relevance of analyzing subcortical structures at the vertex level, which may identify alterations that are averaged out at the gross volumetric level.\n\nSub-regions of the hippocampus that were among the top contributors to the PCA performed across CNVs- were also previously reported in shape analysis of MDD (33) and SZ (30). The observed shape differences have been reported to reflect patterns of neuronal deficits in postmortem studies of individuals with schizophrenia (30). For example, the mixed findings"

      "markdown": "for caudate - increase and decrease for shape metrics in sub-regions - reflect findings from postmortem studies showing both larger (58) as well as smaller disease-related changes in total neuron number (59). The PC1 loadings of gross volume correlated with mean PC loadings for shape analysis, reflecting a consistent latent dimension. The microscopic reductions in neuron size or total number of neurons, that reflect shape differences, may manifest in macroscopic reductions in volume measured by MRI (30).\n\nWhile shared variation could have been influenced by clinical ascertainment or psychiatric diagnoses, sensitivity analyses showed that this is not the case, consistent with previous publications (54). Larger sample sizes with complete balanced coverage of the lifespan age range will be required for more accurate normative modeling (60). Direct comparison of shape metrics between CNVs and psychiatric conditions is required to identify latent dimensions across CNVs and conditions and will be the focus of future studies.\n\nIn summary, effect sizes of CNVs on subcortical structures were correlated with their effect size on cognition and risk for disease. Shape analyses highlighted subregional volume alterations that were averaged out in global volume analyses. Principal components captured common effects on subcortical volumes across CNVs and NPDs may underly some of the pleiotropic effects of CNVs. Basal ganglia and limbic structures contributed to the latent dimension for volume are also those contributing to latent dimension for surface and thickness."

Red/yellow colors indicate positive coefficients, or regions with increased thickness in the CNV group compared with the controls. Gray regions indicate areas of no significant difference after correction for multiple comparisons. Each vertex was adjusted for sex, site, age, and intracranial volume (ICV).
