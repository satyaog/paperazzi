We profile 782 longitudinal plasma samples from 318 hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Integrated analysis using kmeans reveal four patient clusters in a discovery cohort: mechanically ventilated critically-ill cases are subdivided into good prognosis and high-fatality clusters (reproduced in a validation cohort), while noncritical survivors are delineated by high and low antibody responses. Only the high-fatality cluster is enriched for transcriptomic signatures associated with COVID-19 severity, and each cluster has distinct RBD-specific antibody elicitation kinetics. Both critical and non-critical clusters with delayed antibody responses exhibit sustained IFN signatures, which negatively correlate with contemporaneous RBDspecific IgG levels and absolute SARS-CoV-2-specific B and CD4+ T cell frequencies. These data suggest that the \"Interferon paradox\" previously described in murine LCMV models is operative in COVID-19, with excessive IFN signaling delaying development of adaptive virus-specific immunity.\n\n## KEYWORDS\n\nCOVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, antibody, cytokines, RNAemia, T cell, B cell, IFN paradox, endotypes, dimensionality reduction."

Qualitative and kinetic differences in viral loads and immune responses have been associated with clinical severity: we (1) and others (2-5) have shown that SARS-CoV-2 plasma viral RNA (vRNA) levels predict fatality in COVID-19 patients. However, some patients succumbed to their infection in the absence of high plasma vRNA, while other individuals with high vRNA survived (1), indicating a role for additional factors.\n\nHigh amounts of inflammatory cytokines have also been linked with fatal outcome (6-8). These cytokines are implicated in immunopathology since immunomodulatory treatments such as IL-6R antagonists (9, 10), systemic corticosteroids (11), and Janus kinase inhibitors (4) improve COVID-19 patients' survival. Despite the well-established roles of interferon (IFN) pathways in priming of antiviral immunity and evidence that pre-existing defects of type I IFN responses are associated with adverse prognosis (12, 13), recombinant type I IFN therapy failed to improve COVID-19 outcomes (14) and may even be detrimental in severe disease (15). This apparent paradox is consistent with observations that sustained IFN levels impair lung healing (16), while their impact on adaptive immunity remains to be determined. In addition, delayed antibody responses (17, 18), possibly linked to disrupted coordination between virus-specific T and B cells (19), have been observed in patients with fatal disease.\n\nGiven the highly dynamic nature of COVID-19, binning patients based on clinical characteristics across the duration of their hospitalization can blur our understanding of the disease course. Although several studies have shown outcome associations with immunovirological feature(7, 8, 20), we still lack a global understanding of the immunovirological kinetics associated with disease heterogeneity. Endotypes, in which patients are grouped based on molecular rather than clinical characteristics, allow a more accurate identification of high-risk patient subsets (21). The interplay between these molecular signatures can be visualized and explored through dimensionality reduction.

These endotypes closely associated with clinical severity. Longitudinal profiling and computational modeling of the antibody responses showed that delayed RBD-specific antibody response was a central feature in two clusters. Using whole-blood transcriptional profiling, we show that patients with this delay have sustained IFN signatures. These signatures were also negatively associated with SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ T cell and B cell responses, but not CD8+ T cell responses. These results highlight a role for excessive IFN signaling in disrupting adaptive humoral and cellular immune responses to a human viral infection."

Blood draws were serially done throughout their stay in-hospital at enrollment and at 2, 7, 14, and 30 days. Only acute samples, defined as those collected within 30 days of symptom onset ( $n=630$ in the discovery cohort; 152 in the validation cohort), were considered. We previously observed that plasma vRNA, RBD-specific IgG antibodies, cytokines (TNF $\\alpha$, CXCL13, IL-6, IL-23, CXCL8, CCL2 and IL1Ra), and tissue damage markers [Receptor for Advanced Glycation Endproducts (RAGE), Angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2) and surfactant protein D (SP-D)] were associated to fatal outcome when measured 11 days after symptom onset (DSO11)(1), while associations with RBD-specific IgM and IgA levels did not reach statistical significance (1). For unsupervised data characterization, we considered these 14 measurements in cross-sectional samples taken at DSO11 (+/- 4 days, $n=242$ ) (Fig 1A). We first visualized samples on a 2D scatter plot using the PHATE dimensionality reduction algorithm (22). In parallel, we performed a k-means clustering on the same data. We chose a cluster count of four, as running k-means with a higher number of clusters led to over-fragmentation and small clusters ( $n<20$ ), preventing adequate subgroup characterization. The clustering resulted in two smaller clusters (1: $n=38$ and 2: $n=49$ ) and two larger ones (3: $n=73$ and 4: $n=82$ ), which strongly aligned with regions of the PHATE embedding (Fig 1B). No clinical or demographic data was used for computing the PHATE embedding and clustering.\n\nHospitalized patients display four distinct endotypes of early plasma immunovirological profiles following SARS-CoV-2 infection"

Nearly all patients in cluster 1 had detectable vRNA and at higher amounts than the other clusters, with cluster 3 having the second-highest levels (Fig 1C). To integrate the overall quantities of cytokines, we created a cytokine score through the linear combination of the 7 cytokines surveyed (see Methods for details). This score followed a stepwise decrease between clusters 1, 2, 3, and 4 (Fig 1D). A second score created with the three markers of tissue damage also showed a stepwise decrease from cluster 1 to 4, although there were no differences between clusters 3 and 4 (Fig 1E). At this DSO11 timepoint, the RBD-specific IgG response was high in clusters 2 and 4, low in cluster 1, and undetectable in most subjects of cluster 3 (Fig 1F), with analogous patterns observed for RBD-specific IgM (Fig S1A) and IgA (Fig S1B).\n\nTo assess how these different immunovirological patterns associated with disease severity, we examined the contemporaneous patient status based on the level of respiratory support received (Moderate = no supplemental oxygen; Severe = oxygen on nasal cannula; Critical = non-invasive or invasive mechanical ventilation). Clusters 1 and 2 were enriched for critical patients, while clusters 3 and 4 mainly contained non-critical patients (Fig 1G, Fig S1C). Cluster 1 identified the most severe cases, as reflected by outcome: 50\\% of patients in cluster 1 died within 60 days of symptom onset, while fatal outcome was observed in a minority of the other three clusters (Fig 1H, Fig S1D). This was also reflected in the duration of hospitalization (S1E). Age (Table 1, Fig S1F) and sex (Fig S1G) did not significantly differ among the four clusters after correction for multiple comparisons, and similar distributions of ethnicities were observed as well (Fig S1H). Other demographic characteristics were largely similar between cohorts, except for the enrichment of pre-existing renal failure in cluster 1 (Table 1).\n\nOur analytical approach therefore identified four immunovirological endotypes in SARS-CoV-2 infection at DSO11 (Fig 1I) that not only aligned with contemporaneous disease severity but also delineated probability of survival among critical cases."

The validation cohort had a greater incidence of mechanical respiratory support, in line with recruitment of this cohort exclusively from the ICU (Table 2). Despite these differences, the incidence of fatal outcome was similar. The PHATE and k-mean analyses were performed using a subset of measurements common between both the discovery and validation cohorts, including the 3 antibody measurements, plasma vRNA, 5 of 7 cytokines, and 1 of 3 tissue damage markers (see Methods for details). PHATE produced two natural clusters that again aligned with k-means analysis (Clusters V1 and V2) (Fig 1J). The two clusters recapitulated the immunovirological patterns identified in clusters 1 and 2 in the discovery set. Cluster V1 showed higher viral load (Fig 1K), inflammation (Fig 1L), and tissue damage (Fig 1M). The differences in vRNA and tissue damage markers were less pronounced, likely due to differences in measurement methods and the use of only a subset of analytes compared to the discovery cohort. Cluster V1 also had lower N-specific antibodies at DSO11 (Fig 1N) than cluster V2. Nonetheless, cluster V1 was strongly enriched in fatal outcome (Fig 1O). The strong reproducibility between both cohorts, even with the use of a subset of the original set of analytes and differences in the SARS-CoV-2 target of the antibodies measured, validates the use of the PHATE/k-means analysis of early plasma profile to classify patient heterogeneity.\n\n## Delayed antibody kinetics is associated with protracted plasma vRNA over a wide range of disease severity\n\nGiven the differences in antibody levels among the discovery clusters at DSO11, we examined whether these resulted from either a delay or an inability in generating anti-RBD antibodies.

This delayed antibody response was also observed in the validation cohort (Fig S2BC). We also measured the evolution of RBD-specific IgM (Fig S2D) and IgA (Fig S2E) and observed delayed responses in Clusters 1 and 3 that were similar to those observed for IgG. Thus, this delayed kinetics cannot be selectively attributed to impaired class switching.\n\nWe next investigated whether there were also differences in plasma viral RNAemia throughout infection (herein referred to as vRNA exposure). 97\\% of cluster 1's patients had detectable plasma vRNA at least once during their hospital stay, compared to 65\\% of cluster 2 patients, 55\\% of cluster 3, and $41 \\%$ of cluster 4 (Fig S2F). We fitted a 4 -knot spline curve onto the average vRNA per day per cluster and calculated the area under the curve (AUC) per clusters, as a metric for overall exposure (Fig 2B). Cluster 1's vRNA AUC was significantly greater than that of clusters 2 and 4. Cluster 3 also had significantly greater vRNA exposure compared to cluster 4. Taken together, these results indicate that, among patients with detectable plasma vRNA, those with delayed antibody generation had greater overall exposure to plasma vRNA compared to their severity-matched counterparts.\n\nTo better understand how the plasma cytokine and tissue damage profiles evolved, we created a PHATE embedding using the 10 cytokine and tissue damage variables, with days since symptom onset (upweighted, methods for details) for all available data points within DSO28 of the discovery cohort ( $n=242$ subjects, 630 data points, Fig 2C).

Various immune signatures were enriched among genes displaying higher expression in the low-antibody response clusters 1 and 3, most notably the IFN gamma response and IFN alpha response pathways (FDR < 2e-4, Fig 3G, Table S3). Compared to its high-antibody counterpart, cluster 3 had increased signatures of complement and TNF $\\alpha$ signaling, and cluster 1 had increased oxidative phosphorylation (Fig 3G). Gene ontology enrichments on the Biological processes (25) similarly showed that patient clusters with delayed antibody responses were enriched for pathways related to IFN signaling and to the defense against invading pathogens (Fig S3H, Table S3), with cluster 3 further enriched for pathways related to regulation of cytokine production and TLR7 signaling (Fig S3I, Table S3). Overall, the transcriptomic profile of low-antibody clusters was characterized by heightened defense pathways against pathogens and type I and II IFN signatures."

In line with the enrichment analyses, clusters 1 and 3 had significantly higher ssIFN scores than clusters 2 and 4, respectively. The ssIFN score showed a strong negative correlation with contemporaneous RBDspecific IgG levels (Fig 3I), and showed weaker positive correlations with contemporaneous plasma vRNA (Fig S3J), cytokine scores (Fig S3K), and tissue damage scores (Fig S3E).

While RBD-specific B cells were detectable in convalescent patients (Fig S4CD), RBD-specific PB were only detectable during acute infection (Fig S4EF), in line with the kinetics of circulating PB in COVID-19 (26). To account for lymphopenia in COVID-19 patients (26), we used contemporaneous clinical complete blood counts (CBC) to calculate the absolute frequencies of RBD-specific B cells and PB per mL of blood.

We also found that excessive IFN signaling likely contributes to differential kinetics of virus-specific antibody, B cell and CD4+ T cell responses. Early robust antibody and T cell immunity, coupled with a low inflammatory profile and low plasma viremia, is associated with moderate disease and good prognosis (cluster 4). When robust SAR-CoV-2-specific immune responses are maintained in the setting of a higher inflammatory profile, as typically observed in critical disease, the prognosis is still good (cluster 2). Patients with sustained IFN signaling also have delayed antibody and CD4+ T cell responses, which can be associated with a good prognosis if viremia and inflammation are low or moderate (cluster 3). However, sustained IFN signaling coupled with high viremia, exacerbated inflammatory profile and low SARS-COV-2-specific B cell and CD4+ T cell responses is associated with the distinctively high-fatality cluster 1.\n\nAmong critically ill patients, our approach delineated the subset of individuals at very high risk of fatality from those with unexpectedly good prognosis with greater accuracy compared to binning patients based on clinical severity, underlining the advantage of using immunovirological endotypes. The cluster-based method combined with model fitting and bootstrap pairwise comparisons made up for the sparsity of data points per patient, allowing for robust comparisons of trajectories in a timedependent manner. The findings were highly reproducible in a separate cohort located in a different country, despite differences in the laboratory methods used. This robustness of the k-means algorithm, which builds on the high-dimensional relationships of features rather than absolute values, can be a major asset in multicentric translational biomedical research, where ensuring reproducibility of data can be complicated by the use of diverse technical platforms (e.g., institutional clinical lab instruments).

Indeed, the modeled curves converged prior to DSO30, consistent the robust SARS-CoV-2 specific antibody responses in convalescent individuals after critical disease. One unavoidable limitation here is possible survivorship bias, as we cannot determine if the critical cases who succumbed early in disease course had the potential to mount this response. These granular analyses also differentiate vRNA kinetics that do not merely align with clinical severity and were not identified by more traditional statistical tools $(1,30)$. While vRNA loads were highest in the high-fatality cluster 1, they were also sustained in the low-antibody, non-critical cluster 3, whereas both clusters that rapidly developed RBD-specific antibodies (2 and 4) readily achieved viral clearance. These results are consistent with the critical role of antibody responses in controlling viral replication. In outpatients, antiSpike neutralizing monoclonal antibodies and antiviral drugs decrease the risk of disease progression only when given early after symptom onset (31, 32). There is also no or limited impact of monoclonal antibodies in people hospitalized for COVID-19 (33), except for a subset of those who have not yet seroconverted (34). These data indicate that once underway, the pathogenic inflammatory cascades, which diverge as early as DSO8, have limited sensitivity to these interventions.\n\nWhole-blood transcriptional profiling provided important insight into the molecular features underpinning these endotypes. While the hierarchy of the COVID-19 severity signature we previously established (23) followed the clinical profile, pair-wise comparisons between the two critical clusters (1 vs 2) and between the non-critical clusters ( 3 vs 4 ) revealed differences in gene expression beyond disease severity. The pathways upregulated in low-antibody clusters 1 and 3, including IL-6-JAKSTAT3 signaling and other inflammatory pathways, are those for which blunting through therapies results in survival benefit (specifically by tocilizumab, sarilumab and baricitinib; and broadly by"

Signatures of complement activation and signaling through TLR7 and TNF $\\alpha$ were only upregulated in cluster 3, suggesting that innate immunity may contribute to a moderate disease course despite sustained IFN signaling. Conversely, fatal cases of cluster 1 had further upregulation of IL-6-JAK-STAT3 signaling and inflammation, with exacerbated TNF signaling compared to cluster 1's survivors. They also exhibited lower expression of MYC targets, which include many proliferation and anti-apoptotic pathways, along with depressed metabolic pathways. These findings suggest a disruption of key cellular processes in patients who subsequently succumb to their illness, which may help guide investigations of new therapeutic targets.\n\nBecause of potential mechanistic implications, a key novel finding of the transcriptional analyses is the differential kinetics of both type I and II IFN signatures among patient clusters. Although pronounced in cluster 1 fatalities, exacerbated IFN signatures did not merely coincide with disease severity, but rather with impaired generation of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody, B cell and CD4+ T cell responses. These defects are probably causally linked, given the critical role of CD4+ T cell help for B cells (35). In contrast, we observed no significant associations with CD8+ T cell responses. These patterns suggest that protracted activation of IFN pathways can adversely affect some anti-SARS-CoV-2-specific responses, in addition to impairing repair mechanisms of damaged lung tissues (36, 37). Seminal studies in the murine lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) model support this hypothesis $(28,38)$ : while IFNs are critical in the early generation of antiviral responses, sustained type I IFN signaling in chronic Clone 13 infection was associated with poor antibody, B cell and CD4+ T cell responses. In this context, blockade of type I interferon signaling by an anti-IFNAR1 antibody decreased viral loads and improved immune responses. A similar benefit has recently been observed though the modulation of type I IFN in SARS-CoV-2 infection of rhesus macaques (39). This dual role of IFN, where timing, rather than quantity, is central to an appropriate adaptive response, is dubbed \"The Interferon paradox\" (40), and is also supported by data in SIV infection of non-human primates(41). In conjunction with data supporting a protective role of IFNs early in COVID-19 course"

This explains discrepancies around IFN in the literature. Individuals with inborn errors in type I IFN responses (13), genetic variants which lower IFN responsiveness (42) or pre-existing anti-IFN autoantibodies(12) are at greater risk of severe COVID-19 because they never have the initial IFN (key for reducing viral replication and the generation of an initial anti-viral response). However, the IFN signature should drop quickly, or it hampers the antiviral response and causes immunopathology. Patients are often put on mechanical ventilation around 9 days after symptom onset, so studies comparing critical and non-critical cases enrich in patients at those times, which is why high IFN signal was associated to severe disease in blood transcriptomics (43) and lung in situ (44) studies. It also explains the results from the clinical trial with IFN(14): it was administer too late to have any beneficial effect, and only the few people with genetic defects would have truly benefited from it.\n\nIn summary, we show that SARS-CoV-2-infected patients experiencing high, sustained IFN signaling have a delayed generation of Spike-specific $\\mathrm{CD}^{+}{ }^{+} \\mathrm{T}$ cells and RBD-specific B cells. This directly links to a delay in the antibody response against the virus and, in patients also presenting increased inflammation, tissue damage, and plasma RNAemia, is associated with a highly fatal profile. Compared to mechanistic studies in mice, a weakness of the present observational study is the lack of direct manipulation of the type I IFN pathway. However, our results can have direct clinical relevance, and at least in part explain why clinical trials of recombinant IFN therapy have yielded disappointing results in COVID-19 (45). While our study lacked investigation of the lung compartment, others also support a pathophysiologic role of excessive type I IFN in this organ (16, 36). Hence, excessive type I IFN signaling is likely detrimental at multiple levels that involves adaptive immunity, and tissue repair. Whether targeted blockade of IFN pathways - rather than IFN supplementation - might be beneficial in specific subgroups of COVID-19 patients would require further investigation."

COVID-19 hospitalized patients were stratified based on the severity of respiratory support at the DSO11 timepoint: critical patients required mechanical ventilation [noninvasive ventilation, endotracheal intubation, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation - (ECMO)], and non-critical patients, encompassing patients with moderate disease required no supplemental oxygen and patients with severe disease requiring oxygen supplementation by nasal cannula. Mortality was followed up to DSO60. Medical charts were reviewed by physicians and study coordinators for data collection on demographics, comorbidities, risk factors, severity state, time of infection, etc. (see Table 1).

While PCA(48) is commonly used, the resulting components are restricted to a linear projection of the input data, thereby limiting the expressiveness of the resulting visualizations. Recent advances in dimensionality reduction techniques instead favor so-called manifold learning algorithms, such as PHATE (Potential of Heat-diffusion for Affinity-based Trajectory Embedding), which can compute a nonlinear transformation of the data to effectively represent the latent structure of a dataset in low dimensions (22). PHATE begins by computing a sample-sample affinity graph, i.e., a graph connecting pairs of similar samples to form \"neighborhoods\". The graph can then be leveraged to compute transition probabilities - the probability of a sample \"jumping\" to one of its' graph neighbors in a random walk. By iteratively repeating this operation in a process known as diffusion, transition probabilities can"

Armed with these similarities, PHATE computes a two-dimensional embedding where the Euclidean distance reflects the dataset's intrinsic structure as captured by diffusion, thus enabling the interpretation and analysis of high dimensional data Data samples are subsequently embedded in a low dimensional space (usually, 2 dimensions for visualization on scatter plots) by preserving both the local and long-range pairwise similarities, meaning the distance between \"neighborhoods\" in the embedding are meaningful. Intuitively, this can be thought as « unfolding » the sample-sample graph in low dimensions while preserving the graph's intrinsic structure, as captured by diffusion affinities.\n\nIn practice, only explanatory variables (in our case, plasma concentrations) are used as input to PHATE and the structure of the embedding is therefore entirely unsupervised. PHATE then generates informative low-dimensional representations of the data and is known to preserve substructures of interest —such as clusters-while being robust to noise and non-uniform sampling of the underlying data manifold. Any variable of interest - such as patient outcome or clinical data - can be used for coloring. Particularly, explanatory variables can be used as color gradients to observe how they are distributed on the visualization (e.g., to identify high antibody and low antibody neighborhoods).\n\n# DSO11 PHATE embeddings \n\nWe computed PHATE visualizations of cross-sectional samples taken 11 days after symptom onset (DSO11 +/- 4 days) in the discovery cohort ( $n=242,14$ measurements) and the validation cohort ( $n=$ 76, 10 measurements).

The time horizon was increased to include all samples from DSO0 to DSO28. Only samples from patients selected for the DSO11 analysis were considered to better understand the progression of the identified DSO11 subgroups in the discovery cohort. Contrary to the previous embedding, each resulting 2D marker reflects a sample ( $n=491$ ) and the same patient can be represented multiple times. To emphasize temporal structure, DSO was used as an input for PHATE, in addition to the 10 cytokine and tissue damage log concentrations. We again centered the data (mean 0 ) and apply standard scaling (variance 1). We then upweighted the time variable by a factor of $\\sqrt{ } 8$ in distance computations in PHATE to better visualize time, as suggested in (22). The resulting PHATE embedding is colored by the average of the 10 standard scaled log concentrations used as input.\n\nTo visualize the evolution of the DSO11 clusters, we computed one multivariate linear regression on the samples of each cluster using DSO as the explanatory variable and the 10 log concentrations as a multivariate response.

This entails that patients may be sampled more than once, or even be missing from the bootstrap sample. Then, for a given patient in the bootstrap sample, the second stage consists in randomly sampling its observations with replacement, generating a patient sub-sample with the same number of observations the patient had in the original sample. Again, in this stage, some of the patient's observations can be sampled multiple times, or missing, owing to the fact that sampling is done with replacement. All such patient sub-samples are aggregated into a full bootstrap sample. Typically, one generates a large amount of bootstrap samples and uses the distribution of the test statistic across these bootstrap samples as an estimate of the true underlying distribution, which can be hard, or even impossible, to derive analytically (53).

To obtain estimates of the PHATE effects, the following linear model was run for each pairwise PHATE contrast:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\mathrm{M}_{1}: E\\left(i_{i} j\\right) \\sim \\beta_{i j}(i)+\\beta_{P H A T E}(i) \\cdot P H A T E(j)+\\beta_{\\text {age }}(i) \\cdot \\text { age }(j)+\\beta_{B M I}(i) \\cdot B M I(j)+\\beta_{\\text {sex }}(i) \\cdot \\operatorname{sex}(j) \\\\\n& +\\beta_{\\text {flowcell }}(i) \\cdot \\text { flowcell }(j)+\\beta_{C B C 1}(i) \\cdot C B C 1(j)+\\beta_{C B C 2}(i) \\cdot C B C 2(j)+\\varepsilon(i, j)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nHere, $\\beta_{i j}(i)$ is the global intercept accounting for the expected collection center-corrected expression of gene $i$ in a female individual in the baseline PHATE cluster, and $\\beta_{P H A T E}(i)$ indicates the effect of the non-baseline PHATE cluster (PHATE(j)) on gene i. For example, in the PHATE cluster contrast 1 vs 2, individuals in PHATE cluster 2 represent the baseline gene expression signature, and $\\beta_{P H A T E}(i)$ represents the effect of PHATE cluster 1 on gene expression. Further, age represents the meancentered, scaled (mean $=0, \\mathrm{sd}=1$ ) age per individual, body mass index (BMI) represents the meancentered, scaled (mean $=0, \\mathrm{sd}=1$ ) BMI per individual, sex represents the self-identified sex for each"

      "markdown": "individual (factor levels = \"Female\", \"Male\"), and flow cell represents the flow cell on which the sample was sequenced (seven factors in total). If BMI was not reported for an individual, this missing data was filled with the average BMI value across all individuals. Because we modeled whole blood expression data, two additional covariates were included, corresponding to the first two principal components of a PCA performed on an $\\mathrm{n} \\times \\mathrm{m}$ cell type proportion matrix (where $\\mathrm{n}=$ number of samples $=630, \\mathrm{~m}=$ number of cell types $=5$, with the matrix populated by the cell type proportions derived from clinical complete blood count [CBC] data) to account for the majority of the variance introduced by underlying cell type composition (PC1 percent variance explained (PVE) = 88.3\\%, PC2 PVE = 7.8\\%, total = $96.1 \\%$ ). Their corresponding effects on gene expression are represented by $\\beta_{C B C 1}(i)$ and $\\beta_{C B C 2}(i)$. Finally, $\\varepsilon(i, j)$ represents the residuals for each gene $i$, individual $j$ pair.\n\nThese models were fit using the ImFit and eBayes functions in limma(59), and the estimates of the PHATE effects $\\beta_{\\text {PHATE }}(i)$ were extracted across all genes along with their corresponding p-values. We controlled for false discovery rates (FDR) using an approach analogous to that of Storey and Tibshirani (60, 61), which makes no explicit assumptions regarding the distribution of the null model but instead derives it empirically. To obtain a null, we performed 100 permutations, where PHATE cluster label was permuted across individuals.\n\n# Calculation of ssGSEA scores \n\nTo construct the IFN and COVID-19 severity score metrics, we calculated single-sample Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (ssGSEA) scores using the Gene Set Variation Analysis (GSVA) package in R (v1.32.0) with default parameters and method = \"ssgsea\"(62). For the IFN ssGSEA score, the input genes were those belonging to the hallmark IFN gamma and alpha response pathways(63). For the COVID-19 severity ssGSEA score, the input genes were those previously described to be positively associated with increased COVID-19 susceptibility in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from COVID19 patients(23)."

The enrichment program specifications and the data in which they were used to assess enrichments are described below:\n\nThe R package fgsea (v1.10.1) was used to perform gene set enrichment analysis for the cluster 1 vs 2 effects, cluster 3 vs 4 effects, and cluster 1 survivor vs deceased effects using the H hallmark gene sets(24). T-statistics were obtained directly from the topTable function in limma(59). The background set of genes were those sufficiently expressed (i.e. passed the lowly-expressed gene filter threshold) in the whole blood expression data. The t-statistics were then ranked, and these pre-ranked t-statistics were used to perform the enrichment using fgsea with the following parameters: minSize = 15, maxSize $=500$, nperm $=100000$. Enrichment scores (ES) and Benjamini-Hochberg (64) adjusted p-values output by fgsea were collected for each analysis.\n\nAdditionally, we performed gene set enrichment analysis separately for genes upregulated in cluster 1 and cluster 3 individuals (i.e., the low antibody response clusters) relative to all other genes tested using ClueGO (v2.5.7) (25) in functional analysis mode. The target set of genes was the list of significantly upregulated genes in the cluster 1 or cluster 3 individuals (in the 1 vs 2 and 3 vs 4 contrasts, respectively) and the background set was the list of all genes tested. Specifically, we tested for the enrichment of GO terms related to biological processes (ontology source: GO_BiologicalProcess-EBI-UniProt-GOA_04.09.2018_00h00) using the following parameters: visual style = Groups, default Network Specificity, GO Term Fusion = TRUE, min.

GO Tree Interval level = 8, min. number of genes = 3, min. percentage of genes = 4.0, statistical test used = Enrichment (right-sided hypergeometric test), p-value correction = Bonferroni step down.
