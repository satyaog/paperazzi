Hence, the purpose of this scoping review is to explore the current and future roles of AI in surgical education. Methods: Nine bibliographic databases were searched from January 2010 to January 2021. Full-text articles were included if they focused on AI in surgical education. Results: Out of 14,008 unique sources of evidence, 93 were included. Out of 93, 84 were conducted in the simulation setting, and 89 targeted technical skills. Fifty-six studies focused on skills assessment/classification, and 36 used multiple AI techniques. Also, increasing sample size, having balanced data, and using AI to provide feedback were major future directions mentioned by authors. Conclusions: AI can help optimize the education of trainees and our results can help educators and researchers identify areas that need further investigation.\n\n\n## 1. Introduction\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is growing rapidly in healthcare. A Nature study found that between 2010 and 2020, publications regarding AI in the fields of healthcare had grown exponentially. ${ }^{\\dagger}$ A U.S. study evaluated the perceptions of medical students regarding which specialties would be impacted the most by $\\mathrm{AI} .{ }^{\\ddagger}$ Over $75 \\%$ of the participants believed that AI would have a major impact on medicine during their lifetimes. The majority of students (over 65\\%) believed that radiology and surgery would be impacted by AI sooner and to a greater extent than other specialties. The researchers concluded that AI should be integrated\ninto medical education curricula to dispel any misperceptions towards AI, as well as enable students to take advantage of the technology.\n\nSurgical training is a long process that comes with many challenges: trainees are faced with work-hour and operating room (OR) restrictions, cost pressures, and policies intended to reduce patient waiting times. Adding to these challenges, surgical training is transitioning from a traditional time-based framework to a competency-based model. For example, in Canada, the transition is underway and by 2022 all residency programs will have transitioned completely. Competency-based medical education (CBME) is an outcomes-based approach for the design, implementation, assessment and evaluation of a surgical\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{\\text {a }}$ Corresponding author.
