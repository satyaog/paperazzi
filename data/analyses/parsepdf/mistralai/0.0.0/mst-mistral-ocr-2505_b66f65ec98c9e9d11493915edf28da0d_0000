Degeneration of spinal discs, bony osteophyte growth and ligament pathology results in physical compression of the spinal cord contributing to damage of white matter tracts and grey matter cellular populations. This results in an insidious neurological and functional decline in patients which can lead to paralysis. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) confirms the diagnosis of DCM and is a prerequisite to surgical intervention, the only known treatment for this disorder. Unfortunately, there is a weak correlation between features\n\n[^1]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{a}$ Cumming School of Medicine, Hotchkiss Brain Institute, University of Calgary, 3330 Hospital Drive NW, Calgary, Alberta, T2N4N1, Canada\n    ${ }^{\\mathrm{b}}$ Combined Orthopedic and Neurosurgery Spine Program, University of Calgary, 140929 Street NW, Calgary, Alberta, T2N2T9, Canada\n    ${ }^{\\text {c }}$ Section of Orthopaedic Surgery, Department of Surgery, University of Calgary, 140329 Street NW, T2N2T9, Calgary, Alberta, T2N2T9, Canada\n    ${ }^{\\mathrm{d}}$ Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Cumming School of Medicine, University of Calgary, HMRB 231, 3330 Hospital Drive NW, Calgary, Alberta, T2N4N1, Canada\n    ${ }^{\\mathrm{e}}$ Department of Clinical Neurosciences, Section of Neurosurgery, Cumming School of Medicine, University of Calgary, 1403 29th Street NW, Calgary, Alberta, T2N2T9, Canada\n    ${ }^{\\mathrm{f}}$ Department of Neurosurgery, University of Toronto,149 College Street, 5th Floor, Toronto, Ontario, M5T1P5, Canada\n    ${ }^{8}$ NeuroPoly Lab, Institute of Biomedical Engineering, Polytechnique Montreal, Pavillon Lassonde 2700 Ch de la Tour, Montreal, Quebec, H3T1N8, Canada\n    ${ }^{\\mathrm{h}}$ Functional Neuroimaging Unit, CRIUGM, Université de Montréal, 4565 Queen Mary Rd, Montreal, Quebec, H3W1W5, Canada\n    ${ }^{i}$ Mila - Quebec AI Institute, 6666 Saint-Urbain Street, \\#200, Montreal, Quebec, H2S3H1, Canada\n    ${ }^{j}$ Department of Neurological Surgery, University of California - Davis, 3301 C Street, Suite 1500, Sacramento, CA, 95816, USA\n    Received 22 January 2024; revised 5 April 2024; accepted 23 April 2024\n\n\n[^1]:    FDA device/drug status: Not applicable.\n    Author disclosures: AAS: Grant: Canadian Institutes of Health Research (C).

We hypothesize that the utilization of higher fidelity aMRI scans will increase the effectiveness of machine learning models predicting DCM severity and may ultimately lead to a more efficient protocol for identifying patients in need of surgical intervention.\nSTUDY DESIGN/SETTING: Single institution analysis of imaging registry of patients with DCM. PATIENT SAMPLE: A total of 296 patients in the cMRI group and 228 patients in the aMRI group. OUTCOME MEASURES: Physiologic measures: accuracy of machine learning algorithms to detect severity of DCM assessed clinically based on the modified Japanese Orthopedic Association (mJOA) scale.\nMETHODS: Patients enrolled in the Canadian Spine Outcomes Research Network registry with DCM were screened and 296 cervical spine MRIs acquired in cMRI were compared with 228 aMRI acquisitions. aMRI acquisitions consisted of diffusion tensor imaging, magnetization transfer, $\\mathrm{T}_{2}$-weighted, and $\\mathrm{T}_{2} \\mathrm{~A}$-weighted images. The cMRI group consisted of only $\\mathrm{T}_{2}$-weighted MRI scans. Various machine learning models were applied to both MRI groups to assess accuracy of prediction of baseline disease severity assessed clinically using the mJOA scale for cervical myelopathy.\nRESULTS: Through the utilization of Random Forest Classifiers, disease severity was predicted with $41.8 \\%$ accuracy in cMRI scans and $73.3 \\%$ in the aMRI scans. Across different predictive model variations tested, the aMRI scans consistently produced higher prediction accuracies compared to the cMRI counterparts.\nCONCLUSIONS: aMRI metrics perform better in machine learning models at predicting disease severity of patients with DCM. Continued work is needed to refine these models and address DCM severity class imbalance concerns, ultimately improving model confidence for clinical implementation. (c) 2024 The Author(s).

The symptoms of DCM typically include gait imbalance, pain, loss of hand function, weakness and/or numbness [2].\n\nDCM is first diagnosed clinically and then confirmed with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the cervical spine. Current surgical decision-making paradigms use MRI data to aid in surgical planning but not to identify the extent of spinal cord injury, as the clinical correlation of these findings remains unclear. Surgeons evaluate the severity of disease by obtaining a clinical history of symptoms and a physical examination of the affected individual. In patients with symptomatic progression or at least moderate impairment in disease severity, surgery is the only effective treatment for DCM. In appropriate patients, surgical decompression and potential fusion are thought to limit ongoing damage to the spinal cord in the form of demyelination, axonal damage or ischemia [3]. Although surgery carries important risks, including both short and long-term complications,hese complications are patient and treatment specific [4], and could include dysphagia, infection, and potential neurological and/or functional decline [5]. As a result, patient selection becomes a critical factor in the\noverall determination of outcomes for patients with DCM by balancing risks and benefits.\n\nDCM is often stratified using the modified Japanese Orthopaedic Association (mJOA) scale [6]. The mJOA aims to capture functional and neurological deficiency as a result of DCM through evaluating upper and lower extremity motor dysfunction, upper extremity sensory dysfunction, and sphincter dysfunction. A patient's mJOA score can range from 18 (no neurological deficits) to 0 (complete inability to move hands, complete loss of urinary sphincter control, and total loss of hand sensation) [7]. mJOA scores can be split into severity categories: mild (mJOA $\\geq 15$ ), moderate (mJOA score between 12 and 14), or severe (mJOA of $<12$ ) disease severity [8].\n\nThe work presented in this study addresses an opportunity to improve clinical care by attempting to improve the prediction of severityof disease at the time of MR imaging. In the age of automated analyses and alerts to specialized care teams, surgeons could be made aware of the extent of spinal cord injury sooner and with more confidence than through traditional referral and triage pathways that rely on reporting of clinical signs and symptoms. That being said, the MRI scan types used for severity prediction remain under question. Traditionally, T2w MRI imaging is conducted on individuals with DCM [9] yet evidence suggests that alternative imaging types such as Diffusion Tensor"

      "markdown": "Imaging (DTI) or Magnetization Transfer Scans (MT) may provide further insight into spinal cord demyelination and axon integrity [10,11], which are important markers of disease progression. Furthermore, it has been shown that compression severity may not be directly linked with DCM severity, warranting the use of advanced metrics of axon integrity and demylination to better predict disease severity $[12,13]$.\n\nIn this study, we aim to develop and test machine learning (ML) models tasked with predicting DCM disease severity through the use of MRI-derived quantitative metrics. We compared the accuracy of these machine learning models in predicting disease severity between routine community acquired MRI (cMRI) and an advanced MRI (aMRI) protocol that was developed to evaluate chronic spinal cord injury [14-16]. The aMRI dataset included advanced imaging biomarkers of disease severity which are actively being considered for diagnostic and prognostic abilities [15], whose effectiveness has yet to be determined. By applying the same ML training protocol to cMRI and aMRI data, a direct comparison can be made between the imaging protocols in predicting DCM severity. Through doing this, we aim to better understand if advanced MRI metrics can support the prediction of DCM baseline severity more than traditional cMRI metrics.\n\n## Material and methods\n\n## Study subjects\n\nThe University of Calgary Spine Program is a group of spine-fellowship trained orthopedic and neurological surgeons caring for a population of approximately 2 million persons in Southern Alberta. Since 2016, patients presenting to the clinics with a diagnosis of DCM have been enrolled into the Canadian Spine Outcomes Research Network registry, with approval from the institutional ethics review board (ethics certificate number REB-15-1332). Each patient provided written consent to participate and was followed through the study for 10 years or until the patient withdrew. Patients were offered enrollment into our registry under either the observational or surgical arm provided they do not meet any exclusion criteria. These criteria include previous cervical spinal surgery, concomitant neurological disease (such as multiple sclerosis or stroke), and a new MRI diagnosis of neoplasm or infection. We refer to this dataset as the \"community MRI (cMRI)\" dataset. A full breakdown of the various testing protocols for the community MRI dataset used in this study can be found in our research center's previously published work [17].\n\nA subset of the above listed patients from 2017-2023 were enrolled in a concurrent longitudinal study titled \"Personalized decision making after a diagnosis of cervical myelopathy: quantitative MRI within an artificial intelligence framework.\" This study has been approved by our\ninstitutional research ethics board (certificate number REB-18-1614), and each patient provided additional consent for the collection of an advanced MRI (aMRI) protocol that includes diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), magnetization transfer (MT), and $\\mathrm{T}_{2}{ }^{*}$-weighted image acquisitions in addition to an updated, higher fidelity, $\\mathrm{T}_{2}$-weighted scan. The rationale for the aMRI protocol can be found in the spine generic acquisition protocol paper [16]. A summary of the varying scans and metrics in the aMRI dataset is provided in Table 1.\n\n## Image acquisition\n\nAll aMRI data was acquired on a 3T GE scanner. Subjects were carefully positioned to limit head movement and requested to not move. cMRI scanner models differed as they came from multiple centres across Alberta.\n\nA $\\mathrm{T}_{2}$-weighted acquisition was acquired as follows: FIESTA-C sequence ( $\\mathrm{T}_{2}$-weighted); $512 \\times 512$, NEX 1.0 , FOV 200 mm , slice thickness 0.4 mm ; resulting in a voxel size of $0.4 \\times 0.4 \\times 0.4 \\mathrm{~mm}^{3}$, collected in the coronal plane. The total scan time was approximately 5 minutes per patient. aMRI records also contain sequences suggested in the spine-generic protocol, namely: DTI, MT, and $\\mathrm{T}_{2}{ }^{*}$ weighted image acquisitions, each with 13 axial slices across the C 1 to C 7 vertebrae, using a variable gap to alternate between bone and intervertebral discs. DTI used spinecho single shot echo planar imaging (ssEPI) with 3 acquisitions averaged offline, $\\mathrm{b}=800 \\mathrm{~s} / \\mathrm{mm}^{2}$ in 25 directions, 5 images with $\\mathrm{b}=0 \\mathrm{~s} / \\mathrm{mm}^{2}$, and resolution of $1 \\times 1 \\times 5 \\mathrm{~mm}^{3}$ ( 7 minutes total). MT used 2D spoiled gradient echo with/ without MT prepulse (offset $=1.2 \\mathrm{kHz}$ ), with $1 \\times 1 \\times 5 \\mathrm{~mm}^{3}$ voxels, for 8 minutes total. $\\mathrm{T}_{2}{ }^{*}$-weighted acquisitions used a 2D Multi-Echo Recombined Gradient Echo (MERGE) with 3 echoes at 5,10 , and 15 ms , each with a resolution $0.6 \\times 0.6 \\times 4 \\mathrm{~mm}^{3}$ without interpolation. Total imaging time for all acquisitions together came to approximately 30 minutes after accounting for patient positioning, slice prescription, and high-order shimming.\n\n## Clinical assessment\n\nThe validated modified Japanese Orthopedic Association (mJOA) score was recorded for each patient at the time of diagnosis by the neurosurgeon who enrolled the patient. mJOA severity class was used as the primary target variable in all machine learning models. cMRI and aMRI dataset features were tested as independent variables for model predictions.\n\n## Computational tools\n\nThe versions of the tools used for these methods were as follows: scikit-learn v.0.23.2 [18], pandas v.1.1.3 [19], numpy v.1.19.2 [20], Spinal Cord Toolbox v.4.3 [21], matplotlib v.3.3.2 [22], and FSLeyes v.0.34.2 [23]."

Each patient record was manually inspected to confirm data integrity. Records were excluded if they contained motion artefacts, were mislabeled (eg, the MRI were of the thoracic spine, rather than the cervical spine as labelled), and/or had an insufficient slice count (resulting in the inability for segmentation algorithms to make accurate estimates of spinal cord metrics).\n\n## Spinal cord MRI analysis\n\nSpinal Cord Toolbox (SCT), an all-in-one MRI processing package specialized in spinal cord MRI scans [21], was used for image segmentation for both cMRI and aMRI datasets. The segmentation of the spinal cord was performed for both the cMRI and aMRI datasets using the SCT's \"sct_deepseg_sc\" command [26] or the $\\mathrm{T}_{2}$-weighted, $\\mathrm{T}_{2}{ }^{*}$ weighted, and MT scans. SCT's \"propseg\" command [27] as used for the DTI scan. An example of these segmentations is shown in Fig. 1.\n![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)\n\nFig. 1.

These features included the cross-sectional area, angle between centerline and axial slice in the anterior-posterior (AP) axis and right-left (RL) axis, distance between the major and minor axis of the cord (diameter) in the AP and RL axis, ratio of the focal distance over the major axis length (eccentricity), angle between AP axis of the spinal cord and AP axis of the image (orientation), spinal cord solidity, and spinal cord length [21]. This resulted in 9 features per vertebrae in the $\\mathrm{T}_{2}$-weighted acquisition and 7 features per vertebrae in the $\\mathrm{T}_{2}{ }^{*}$-weighted acquisition (as $\\mathrm{T}_{2}{ }^{*}$-weighted does not contain Angle AP and Angle RL values). DTI and MT scans were analyzed using SCT's \"sct_extract_metric\" script to generate the \"maximum a posteriori\" (MAP) fractional anisotropy value in white matter and magnetization transfer ratio in white matter, respectively [21].\n\nAdditionally, all MRI-derived metrics, we calculated the overall mean, standard deviation, maximum value, minimum value, and the difference between maximum and minimum values ( $\\Delta$ ) for all metrics between the C 2 and T 1 vertebral levels. Age and sex of the patient were included as features in both datasets. This resulted in 53 features overall for the cMRI dataset and 149 features overall for the aMRI dataset (Appendix A for full list).\n\n## Management of missing clinical and excluded metrics\n\nPatients missing a recorded mJOA value or more than 20 percent of their imaging metrics were excluded. Sparsely missing features were imputed using scikitlearn's \"SimpleImputer.\" A specific breakdown of excluded patients can be found in Fig. 2. Metrics from the C 1 level in the $\\mathrm{T}_{2}$-weighted and MT scan, the C 1 -C3 and C7 level of the $\\mathrm{T}_{2}{ }^{*}$-weighted scan, and the $\\mathrm{C} 1, \\mathrm{C} 6$, and C 7 level of the DTI scan were excluded as the SCT automated analysis provided inconsistent and poor registration likely as a result of being near the edge of the scan region introducing an unreasonable amount of noise to the ML model.\n\n## Prediction of baseline disease severity and model performance\n\nBoth cMRI and aMRI datasets were split into a training set of 65 percent of the data and a testing set of 35 percent. All features were scaled to a unit norm using SciKit-Learn's \"StandardScaler\" class. The mJOA score was also binned into 3 primary categories: mild severity (mJOA $\\geq 15$ ), moderate severity ( $\\mathrm{mJOA}=12-14$ ) and severe severity (mJOA $<$ 12) [8]. Three target metrics, as opposed to individual mJOA score predictions, allows the ML model to overcome interrater variablity that is often seen with mJOA evaluation while using a categorical system that has been found to support the assessment of DCM disease severity [8].\n![img-1.jpeg](img-1.jpeg)\n\nFig. 2. Breakdown of patient enrolment pathway and patient disease severity. Following excluded patients and scans, 296 cMRI patients were included. Of these patients, a subset of 228 patients were enrolled into the aMRI group. In the cMRI group, there were an equal number of mild and moderately severe patients ( $\\mathrm{n}=114$ and $\\mathrm{n}=115$, respectively) with a decrease in the amount of severe mJOA patients ( $\\mathrm{n}=67$ ).

A pipeline of each permutation was run in the order they are listed, with each being fed into a Random Forest Classifier, including hyperparameter tuning. Random Forest Classifiers were selected over Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosting Classifier, and Support Vector Classification models based on their performance in preliminary tests.\n\nAccuracy, precision, and recall including a stratifeid 5fold cross validation were calculated for each model generated using the model's predicted mJOA severity class and the patient's true mJOA severity class [18]. Both cMRI and aMRI datasets underwent the same analysis pipeline.\n\n## Results\n\n## Patient enrolment\n\nA total of 394 patients were enrolled in the study from 2016 to 2021. Of the enrolled patients, 380 had a baseline mJOA recorded. Of these, 296 cMRI records met the criteria for inclusion in this study. A total of 228 patients were simultaneously enrolled in the collection of advanced, dis-ease-specific metrics. 214 of these patients had a baseline mJOA and were included in our aMRI dataset. A visualization of the enrolled patients can be seen in Fig. 2.\n\n## Predicting baseline severity in cMRI scan metrics\n\nThe cMRI dataset consisted of 53 derived features from each of the 296 MRI records. The testing accuracy of the model training on data without RFE or LDA/PCA was 41.8 $\\%$, which decreased to $41.1 \\%$ with RFE, and continued on a downward trend with the addition of LDA and PCA (Table 2). In the cMRI group, testing and training accuracies remained relatively the same except for the RFC + LDA model which differed by $30.6 \\%$ accuracy. The Random Forest Classifier model alone performed the best with an accuracy of $41.8 \\%$. The RFC + RFE + LDA model performed the worst with an accuracy of $27.6 \\%$ (Fig. 5).\n\nPrecision and recall scores followed the same trend and performed within $10 \\%$ of their model's respective accuracy. RFE identified 32 of the 53 features as the optimum number of features for the model's performance (Appendix B). The cMRI prediction model performs similarly in predicting mild and moderate disease severities ( $46.0 \\%$ correct and $47.9 \\%$ correct, respectively) but misinterprets all severe mJOA patients as milder (Fig. 3).\n\n## Predicting baseline severity in aMRI scan metrics\n\nThe advanced MRI metrics consisted of 149 features derived from the $\\mathrm{T}_{2}$-weighted, $\\mathrm{T}_{2}{ }^{*}$-weighted, DTI and MT scans. The initial testing accuracy of the model was $73.3 \\%$ which decreased slightly with preprocessing permutations yet remained within $\\sim 6 \\%$ of the initial accuracy (Table 3). RFC + RFE + LDA and RFC + LDA were the two exceptions, dropping down to $50.7 \\%$ and $36.0 \\%$ accuracy, respectively. The Random Forest Classifier model alone performed the best with an accuracy of $73.3 \\%$ but may have overfit with a training accuracy of $1.0 \\%$. The RFC + LDA model performed the worst with an accuracy of $36.0 \\%$. Precision and recall scores followed the same trend and performed within $15 \\%$ of their model's respective accuracy. RFE identified 74 of the 149 features as the optimum number of features for the model's performance (Appendix C). The confusion matrix indicates that the model predicted mild disease severity ( $70 \\%$ correct) most consistently followed by severe DCM ( $38 \\%$ correct) and moderate DCM (36\\%) (Fig. 3).\n\n## Discussion\n\nThis work compares the utility of community acquired diagnostic MRI scans with advanced MRI acquisitions to predict the severity of DCM at the time of diagnosis. The aMRI acquisition protocol was initially designed to capture evidence of spinal cord injury such as demyelination or axonal damage whereas community MRI acquisitions captured evidence of cord compression. The significance of this work lies with the novel implementation of machine learning models with aMRI acquisitions to better help physicians prioritize patients during triage and during diagnosis. This is important as MRI acquisition protocols for individuals with CSM have remained relatively unchanged\n\nTable 2\nSummarized cross-validated accuracy, precision score, and recall score for tested model variations in the cMRI group\n\n| Model variations | Cross-validated accuracy (testing set) | Cross-validated accuracy (training set) | Specificity | Sensitivity |\n| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |\n| RFC only | 0.418 | 0.370 | 0.343 | 0.343 |\n| RFC+RFE | 0.411 | 0.499 | 0.381 | 0.381 |\n| RFC+RFE+PCA | 0.365 | 0.444 | 0.328 | 0.328 |\n| RFC+RFE+LDA | 0.276 | 0.481 | 0.351 | 0.351 |\n| RFC+PCA | 0.395 | 0.481 | 0.291 | 0.291 |\n| RFC+LDA | 0.298 | 0.604 | 0.388 | 0.388 |\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    RFC=Random Forest Classifier; RFE=Recurssive Feature Elimination; PCA=Principal Component Analysis; LDA=Linear Discriminant Analysis."

The cMRI prediction model was not able to predict any of the severe testing patients correctly. That being said, the model favors making moderate predictions (n=66) slightly more than mild predictions ( $\\mathrm{n}=64$ ). It favors both mild and moderate predictions more than severe predictions ( $\\mathrm{n}=4$ ). The aMRI model predicts $70 \\%$ of the mild patients correctly, $36 \\%$ of the moderate patients correctly, and $38 \\%$ of the severe patients correctly.\nsince the 1980s while the available analysis tools and scans have improved [9]. Furthermore, through analyzing which specific metrics had the most profound impact on disease severity prediction, we are better able to determine which scans should be prioritized by physicians. Ultimately, this work aimed to understand if aMRI metrics can better support DCM severity prediction than cMRI metrics alone.\n\nWe demonstrated that overall aMRI acquisitions outperform cMRI in baseline disease severity prediction (Fig. 5). That being said, the aMRI and cMRI datasets had substantial class imbalances due to the nature of the patient population and the likelihood of milder patients enrolling in research studies. These class imbalances must be taken into consideration when comparing and evaluating model evaluation metrics. In addition, we demonstrated that cMRI acquisitions alone fail to accurately predict disease severity when utilizing simple machine learning models. The cMRI dataset did not surpass $42 \\%$ accuracy in any of the testing models despite the inclusion of RFE and PCA/LDA. Furthermore, the cMRI prediction model appeared to act naively in predicting severe disease severity, failing to accurately identify any patients with severe DCM. We suspect that this is due to imbalance in the cMRI dataset with a\nmajority ( $77 \\%$ ) of patients being mild and moderate severity, biasing predictions towards the more common mild and moderate DCM classes. It may also indicate that the cMRIderived metrics are insufficient for simple machine learning models to function effectively or that these simple models simply cannot work effectively with cMRI-derived metrics. The cMRI set is limited to only metrics capturing metrics of spinal cord compression. With previous studies showing that focal compression of the spinal cord may not correlate with disease severity, it is likely that the cMRI model simply did not have enough information to accurately capture the severity of DCM present [13].\n\nIn the aMRI dataset, the model's performance begins to plateau past 25 features and fully levels out with minor fluctuation beyond 55 features (Fig. 4). This indicates that there are many possible combinations of features that can be used to predict disease severity, though many of these combinations are also redundant. Of the 74 features that were ranked as optimal by RFE, $27 \\mathrm{~T}_{2}$-weighted metrics were selected, $41 \\mathrm{~T}_{2}{ }^{*}$-weighted metrics were selected, 4 DT scan metrics were selected, and 2 MT scan metrics were selected. With more than half stemming from aMRIderived features, it is apparent that the accuracy benefits\n\nTable 3\nSummarized cross-validated accuracy, precision score, and recall score for tested model variations in the aMRI group\n\n| Model variations | Cross-validated accuracy (testing set) | Cross-validated accuracy (training set) | Precision score | Recall score |\n| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |\n| RFC only | 0.733 | 1.0 | 0.555 | 0.327 |\n| RFC+RFE | 0.640 | 0.842 | 0.669 | 0.455 |\n| RFC+RFE+PCA | 0.613 | 0.778 | 0.673 | 0.478 |\n| RFC+RFE+LDA | 0.507 | 0.683 | 0.682 | 0.359 |\n| RFC+PCA | 0.680 | 0.993 | 0.629 | 0.388 |\n| RFC+LDA | 0.360 | 1.00 | 0.653 | 0.367 |\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    RFC=Random Forest Classifier; RFE=Recursive Feature Elimination; PCA=Principal Component Analysis; LDA=Linear Discriminant Analysis."

The cMRI group training accuracy began at $\\sim 39 \\%$ accuracy compared to the aMRI group of $\\sim 55 \\%$. Both models present an upward trend as more features are selected with the aMRI group beginning to plateau past 55 selected features. The cMRI group showed the greatest accuracy fluctuations around $\\sim 20-37$ selected features with the aMRI group having the greatest accuracy fluctuations around $\\sim 0-25$ selected features.\nobserved are at least in part due to the improved aMRI methodology. That being said, the models shown in this study cannot be used as standalone ML models for disease severity prediction but do provide insight into the utility of aMRI metrics in supporting disease prediction.\n\nFor example, both datasets took the $\\mathrm{T}_{2} \\mathrm{w}$ CSA area at lower vertebral levels (such as C6 and maximum values) which is in line with evidence to suggest that impactful compression is more often seen at lower cervical vertebral levels [28]. While both aMRI and cMRI datasets looked at the same features for the $\\mathrm{T}_{2} \\mathrm{w}$ scan, the aMRI dataset outlined fewer $\\mathrm{T}_{2} \\mathrm{w}$ important features than the cMRI dataset. This suggests that the new features introduced via the aMRI methodology were able to provide the information relied upon in the cMRI methodologies via another method, likely the result of the higher fidelity sequences obtained.\n\nWhen comparing the confusion matrix between the cMRI and aMRI datasets, it is evident that the aMRI dataset outperformed the cMRI dataset in mild and severe patients\n![img-4.jpeg](img-4.jpeg)\n\nFig. 5. Accuracy score visualization for different model variations compared between the cMRI dataset and the aMRI dataset metrics. Both cMRI and aMRI dataset accuracies show minimal fluctuations between model variations. That being said, all the aMRI models outperform their cMRI counterparts. The largest difference between cMRI and aMRI accuracy scores is seen in the RFC only model with a $31.5 \\%$ prediction accuracy difference. The smallest difference between the cMRI and aMRI accuracy scores is seen in the RFC+LDA model with a $6.2 \\%$ prediction accuracy difference. RFC=Random Forest Classifier; RFE=Recurssive Feature Elimination; PCA=Principal Component Analysis; LDA=Linear Discriminant Analysis.\nwhile the cMRI dataset outperformed the aMRI dataset in moderate severity patients. Both confusion matrices also allude to potential model naivety with each having the greatest correctly predicted class being the majority class.\n\nThis work serves to demonstrate the potential of imaging sequences beyond T2-weighted scans in predicting DCM disease severity. MRI scans have often been considered unreliable in determining DCM disease severity, likely because they can primarily only provide anatomical information. With the emergence of DTI and MT scans in DCM clinical care, information regarding axon integrity and demyelination can be quantified. This study demonstrated that, while still unclear, there is valuable quantitative information from DTI and MT scan images for DCM disease diagnosis. The refinement of these tools can aid in patient triage and may provide clinicians with a greater understanding of spinal cord injury on a case-by-case basis. However, the implementation of DTI and MT images to standard community-based acquisitions is challenging, and feasibility concerns are present.\n\n## Limitations\n\nA major limitation in this study was the lack of moderate and severe mJOA patient samples within the aMRI and cMRI diagnostic dataset. This limits the model's generalizability and confidence to be used as a standalone clinical tool for determining DCM severity. Another major limitation of this study was the variability in MRI scanning methodology for the community MRI dataset as compared to the aMRI set. The aMRI dataset had a strict acquisition protocol while the cMRI dataset was exposed to inter-clinic variability in acquisition methodology, likely leading to cMRI records having significantly more \"noise\" than equivalent aMRI records.\n\nFuture focus will be on developing tools to predict longterm patient outcomes for both surgical and observational arms. To accomplish this, physician gathered metrics are currently being taken of patients to assess gait and balance, hand function, and global function of patients. These will be used as features in future models to determine if the gathering of these directed tests is useful in disease diagnosis or prognosis. Neural network models will be tested as well to assess whether they can bypass the limitations of the random forest models tested here. These models will also be able to accept MRI sequences directly, bypassing the need for extensive preprocessing and feature extraction. Finally, MRI sequence collection for both the cMRI and aMRI datasets is expected to continue, with future studies with these enlarged datasets aiming to balance the dataset to avoid the misbalancing issues observed within our current results.\n\n## Conclusions\n\nThe utilization of computer-based predictive modelling has a promising future in the prediction of baseline"

      "markdown": "DCM disease severity. In this paper, the utilization of aMRI acquisitions such as $\\mathrm{T}_{2}{ }^{*}$-weighted, DT imaging, and MT imaging have been shown to improve DCM severity prediction accuracy by 20 percent on average as compared to cMRI-derived metrics alone. Of the advanced acquisitions, $\\mathrm{T}_{2}{ }^{*}$-weighted scans had the greatest impact in the increased accuracy score. Based on these results, the increased sequence fidelity obtained via the aMRI methodology appears to improve machine learning effectiveness, though improvements remain. These results were limited by the size and composition of our datasets, something which further data collection will alleviate. Such results are promising, but future work looking into neural network-based models and improved patient metric selection must be completed before potential applications in a clinical setting can be considered.\n\n## Declaration of competing interest\n\nOne or more of the authors declare financial or professional relationships on ICMJE-TSJ disclosure forms.\n\n## CRediT authorship contribution statement\n\nAbdul Al-Shawwa: Writing - review \\& editing, Writing - original draft, Visualization, Methodology, Formal analysis, Data curation, Conceptualization.
