How different Mbp mRNA levels affect myelin dimensions across the lifespan and how resident glial cells may respond to such changes are unknown. Here, to investigate these questions, we used enhancer-edited mouse lines that accumulate Mbp mRNA levels ranging from $8 \\%$ to $160 \\%$ of wild type. In young mice, reduced Mbp mRNA levels resulted in corresponding decreases in Mbp protein accumulation and myelin sheath thickness, confirming the previously demonstrated ratelimiting role of Mbp transcription in the control of initial myelin synthesis. However, despite maintaining lower line specific Mbp mRNA levels into old age, both MBP protein levels and myelin thickness improved or fully normalized at rates defined by the relative Mbp mRNA level. Sheath length, in contrast, was affected only when mRNA levels were very low, demonstrating that sheath thickness and length are not equally coupled to Mbp mRNA level. Striking abnormalities in sheath structure also emerged with reduced mRNA levels. Unexpectedly, an increase in the density of all glial cell types arose in response to reduced Mbp mRNA levels. This investigation extends understanding of the role MBP plays in myelin sheath elaboration, architecture, and plasticity across the mouse lifespan and illuminates a novel axis of glial cell crosstalk.\n\n\n## KEYWORDS\n\nastrocyte, hypermyelination, hypomyelination, Mbp transcription, microglia, myelin basic protein, myelin elaboration and plasticity, myelin sheath thickness and length, oligodendrocyte and oligodendrocyte progenitor cell\n\n## 1 | INTRODUCTION\n\nThe acquisition of myelin during vertebrate evolution conferred fundamental enhancements to nervous system function (Castelfranco \\& Hartline, 2016; Zalc et al., 2008). While supporting accelerated and energy efficient conduction of action potentials, myelin sheaths also provide trophic and metabolic support to axons (Cohen et al., 2020; Simons \\& Nave, 2015). Their radial and longitudinal dimensions correlate with the caliber of the axons they surround (Almeida et al., 2011; Hess \\& Young, 1949; Waxman \\& Sims, 1984), but also demonstrate plasticity in response to circuit activity that may serve to synchronize synaptic inputs (Pajevic et al., 2023). Demonstrating the critical role myelin plays in normal nervous system function, inherited, or acquired myelin disruption underlies multiple debilitating diseases (Depp et al., 2023; Stadelmann et al., 2019). Further, when the generation of new myelin is disrupted experimentally in mice, motor task learning, memory, and behavior are perturbed (Bacmeister et al., 2020; Bercury \\& Macklin, 2015; Bergles \\& Richardson, 2015; Bonetto et al., 2021; Pan et al., 2020; Steadman et al., 2020).\n\nMutations in genes encoding myelin components have illuminated the specific roles played by major myelin proteins (Miyata, 2019).\n\nNotable among these are spontaneous and experimentally induced mutations in the Golli/Mbp locus that affect Myelin basic protein (Mbp) expression (Bagheri et al., 2020; Popko et al., 1987; Readhead et al., 1987; Roach et al., 1985; Roch et al., 1987; Shine et al., 1992). Shiverer mice are null for Mbp, and while their oligodendrocytes are capable of ensheathing axons with a few layers of plasma membrane, these typically fail to compact into dense myelin sheaths (Inoue et al., 1981; Roach et al., 1985; Rosenbluth, 1980). In addition, transgenic preparations revealed a close correlation between the volume of elaborated myelin and levels of Mbp mRNA accumulation, thus implicating a rate-limiting role for Mbp imposed at the transcriptional level (Shine et al., 1992). Most recently, experimentally induced deletion of Mbp in mature mice demonstrated that maintenance of preformed sheaths also requires continuous MBP synthesis (Meschkat et al., 2022). Thus, MBP plays an essential role in both myelin elaboration and maintenance. Additionally, GOLLI, the other product of the Golli/Mbp locus, accumulates in multiple lineages, both within and outside the CNS, where it plays a role in $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ signaling (Campagnoni et al., 1993; Cheli et al., 2016; Feng, 2007; Landry et al., 1996; Paez et al., 2009; Paez et al., 2012; Paez \\& Lyons, 2020). Notably, in mice that lack or overexpress GOLLI, myelination in the visual system is perturbed (Jacobs et al., 2005; Jacobs et al., 2009)."

We showed previously that such edits perturb both Golli and Mbp mRNA accumulation resulting in different line-specific levels in the CNS that are maintained up to P90 (Bagheri et al., 2020; Dib et al., 2011). Here, we extend such characterization into old age and include a new line in which M3 was exchanged with a multimerized M3 sub-sequence leading to higher-than-normal Golli/Mbp mRNA accumulation. Combined, these edits result in a 6-member panel in which Mbp mRNA levels range in a graded fashion between $8 \\%$ and $160 \\%$ of wild type (WT), providing novel opportunities to investigate the role of MBP in myelin elaboration and maintenance. We provide insight into the relative role of transcriptional and post-transcriptional control of MBP protein production, the relationship between Mbp mRNA levels and sheath thickness and length, and the consequences of reduced Mbp mRNA levels on sheath architecture. Finally, we observed an unanticipated increase in the density of all glial cell types in response to graded hypomyelination exposing a novel axis of glial crosstalk.\n\n## 2 | METHODS\n\n## 2.1 | Animals\n\nAll experiments were carried out in accordance with the guidelines of the Canadian Council on Animal Care. Protocol number 215-7668 approved by the McGill University DOW Facilities Animal Care Committee. Animals were on a 12 h light/dark cycle and a 2920X Teklad diet from Envigo.\n\nMouse lines were generated as described in Bagheri et al., 2020. The M3KOKI allele is deleted of M3 (chr18:82,567,315-82,568,165 GRCm39/mm39) and is replaced by an insertion of three full and one partial copy of a $\\sim 105 \\mathrm{bp}$ sequence that originates from the core of M3. All analysis was performed on mice derived from litters of 6-8 pups. Pups were weaned between P24-P28 and caged in groups of 4 to 5 of the same sex.\n\n## 2.2 | qRT-PCR and mRNA analysis\n\nSamples from homozygous mice (typically $n=6$ ) of both genders were obtained at the ages indicated (Tables S1 and S2). Mice were anesthetized with a lethal dose of Avertin, and samples of sciatic nerve, cervical spinal cord, optic nerve, and thymus were collected into RNAlater solution (Ambion) according to manufacturer's instructions and stored at $-20^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$. RNA extraction was achieved using Trizol (Life Technologies) and a Qiagen RNeasy MinElute Cleanup kit according to manufacturer's instructions. qRT-PCR was as described in Bagheri et al., 2020. Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism V9.5.1, one-way ANOVA and Dunnett's multiple comparisons or Brown-Forsythe and Welch ANOVA and Dunnett's T3 multiple comparisons tests.\n\n## 2.3 | Western blot\n\nHomozygous mice $(n=3)$ of mixed genders at P14 and P90 were anesthetized with a lethal dosage of Avertin and samples of cervical spinal cord were immediately frozen on dry ice. Extracts were obtained using RIPA lysis buffer and WB was performed using antiGAPDH (Cell Signaling \\#2118), anti-2',3'-Cyclic-nucleotide 3'-phosphodiesterase (CNPase) (Cell Signaling \\#5664), and anti-MBP (SigmaAldrich MAB386). One sample from each genotype and age was run on each gel resulting in three sets of comparisons per age. MBP and CNPase values were first normalized to GAPDH and then to wild type (WT) $(100 \\%)$ of the same set.\n\n## 2.4 | Imaging mass spectrometry peptide and cholesterol analysis\n\nSpinal cord samples from homozygous mice $(n=5)$ of both genders at P90 were collected as for mRNA analysis. Five tissue microarrays (TMAs) each including one sample from each of the eight genotypes were built by encasing spinal cords in 1.5\\% carboxymethylcellulose. Cryostat cross sections (Thermo Fisher Scientific Microm HM550) were cut at $12 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$ thickness and thaw-mounted on indium-tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass slides (Delta Technologies, Loveland, CO) and desiccated for 30 min before further sample preparation. All TMAs were analyzed in triplicate.\n\nFor peptide analysis, sections were washed 30s $70 \\%$ ethanol, 30s 100\\% ethanol, 2 min Carnoy's solution ( $60 \\%$ ethanol, 30\\% chloroform and 10\\% glacial acetic acid), 30s 100\\% ethanol, 30s HPLC-grade water, 30s 100\\% ethanol prior to trypsin digestion (Gessel et al., 2015). Twenty microgram of pierce trypsin protease was dissolved in $250 \\mu \\mathrm{~L}$ of 100 mM ammonium bicarbonate and deposited using an M3 TM-sprayer (HTX Technologies, Chapel Hill, NC, USA) using the following parameters: $750 \\mathrm{~mm} / \\mathrm{min}$ velocity, track spacing $2 \\mathrm{~mm}, 30^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}, 10 \\mathrm{psi}$, pattern VV, 40 mm nozzle height, flow rate of $7.5 \\mu \\mathrm{~L} / \\mathrm{min}$, and 7 passes. The samples were then incubated in a hydration chamber overnight at $37^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ and desiccated prior to matrix application. $\\alpha$-Cyano-4-hydroxyciannamic acid matrix in 50:50 acetonitrile: water, $0.1 \\%$ trifluoroacetic acid was deposited on the samples using the M3 TM-sprayer at $1200 \\mathrm{~mm} / \\mathrm{min}$ velocity, track spacing $3 \\mathrm{~mm}, 65^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}, 10 \\mathrm{psi}$, pattern VV, 40 mm nozzle height. Approximate matrix thickness was $0.001667 \\mathrm{mg} / \\mathrm{mm}^{2}$.\n\nImaging mass spectrometry (IMS) was performed on a MALDI TOF/TOF ultrafleXtreme mass spectrometer equipped with SmartBeam II Nd:YAG/355 nm laser operating at 2000 Hz (Bruker Daltonics, Billerica, MA). IMS data was acquired in positive ion reflectron mode under optimized delayed extraction conditions using 300 shots per pixel with a spatial resolution of $50 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$ in the 700-5000 Da mass range. To estimate protein abundance, a reporter tryptic peptide from the Mbp sequence was chosen at $\\mathrm{m} / \\mathrm{z} 2141.4[\\mathrm{M}+\\mathrm{H}]^{+}$. The identity of this peptide was confirmed by sequencing using MS/MS performed in positive polarity on the MALDI TOF/TOF ultrafleXtreme mass spectrometer (data not shown).\n\nFor cholesterol analysis, spinal cord cross sections were analyzed by silver-assisted laser desorption ionization IMS as described in"

These parameters (argon partial pressure of 0.02 mbar and current of 80 mA for 30 s) give a silver layer of approximately 28 nm thickness. IMS data was acquired in positive ion reflectron mode under optimized delayed extraction conditions using 500 shots per pixel with a spatial resolution of $50 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$ in the $250-1100$ Da mass range. For cholesterol abundance, the peak at $\\mathrm{m} / \\mathrm{z} 493.2\\left[\\mathrm{M}+{ }^{107} \\mathrm{Ag}\\right]^{+}$was considered.\n\nIMS data was visualized in FlexImaging 4.1 software (Bruker Daltonics) and exported into imzML format prior to importation into R (v 4.2.3). Using the Cardinal Package (v 3.2.1), the baseline was reduced, followed by normalization by total ion current (TIC). The average intensity of each pixel for masses of interest were then extracted and combined to generate averages for each region of interest. The most and least intense pixels (top and bottom $10 \\%$ of the data for each region of interest) were excluded from calculations to reduce variability due to outliers and changes in histology throughout the white matter. Using GraphPad Prism V9.5.1, one-way ANOVA and Dunnett's multiple comparisons test were performed, and plots generated.\n\n## 2.5 | Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry cholesterol analysis\n\nIndividual spinal cords from homozygous mice (typically $n=5$ ) of both genders at P90 were thawed on ice and weighed. Extraction solvent (methanol/isopropanol/water, 3/5/2, v/v/v, LC-MS grade) was added keeping a constant tissue to solvent ratio ( $0.1 \\mathrm{~g} / 1 \\mathrm{~mL}$ ). Samples were homogenized using a Precellys (Bertin Technologies, 6500 rpm, 4 cycles of 15 s with 30 s of break) at $15-16^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ using liquid nitrogen cooling, vortexed for 5 min , incubated on ice for 15 min and centrifuged at $25000 \\times \\mathrm{g}$ for 10 min at $4^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$. The resulting supernatant was diluted 1:40 with the extraction solvent prior to analysis. The LC-MS analysis was performed using an untargeted lipidomics method on an Agilent 1100 LC system coupled with an LTQ-Velos Orbitrap (Thermo Fisher Scientific) (Bowden et al., 2017). Chromatographic separation utilized a Waters CSH C18 column ( $130 \\AA$, $2.5 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}, 2.1 \\times 75 \\mathrm{~mm}$ ) with a $0.25 \\mathrm{~mL} / \\mathrm{min}$ flow rate and column temperature of $55^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$. The mobile phase was composed of A: water/ methanol ( $60 / 40, \\mathrm{v} / \\mathrm{v}$ ) with 10 mM of ammonium acetate and B : isopropanol/methanol (90/10) with 10 mM of ammonium acetate. The gradient program was as follows: $0-2 \\mathrm{~min} 20 \\% \\mathrm{~B} ; 2-4 \\mathrm{~min}$ 20\\%-30\\% B; 4-25 min 30\\%-80\\% B; 25-35 min 80\\%-85\\% B, 35-38 min 85\\%-95\\% B, 38-41 min 95\\% B, 41-41.1 min 95\\%-20\\% B; 41.1-50 min 20\\% B. The injection volume was $10 \\mu \\mathrm{~L}$. Mass spectrometry acquisition was performed in positive electrospray mode, with full MS1 scan mass range of 345-1400 m/z at 60,000 resolving power with MS/MS analysis using top eight collision induced dissociation data-dependent acquisition in ion trap at nominal resolution. The identification of cholesterol was confirmed using authentic $5 \\mu \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{mL}$ standard (Sigma Aldrich), and relative quantification was\nperformed using $\\mathrm{m} / \\mathrm{z} 369.3531$ with 5 ppm extraction window using XcaliburTM 2.2 software (Thermo Fisher Scientific). GraphPad Prism V9.5.1, one-way ANOVA and Dunnett's multiple comparisons tests were performed, and plots generated.\n\n## 2.6 | Spinal cord area measurements\n\nHomozygous mice $(n=3-4)$ at P30 were anesthetized with a lethal dose of Avertin and perfused transcardially with 10 mL of 1 X phosphate buffer saline (PBS) followed by 10 mL of $4 \\%$ PFA (FDNeuroTechnologies) at $1 \\mathrm{~mL} / \\mathrm{min}$. Cervical spinal cords were postfixed in $4 \\%$ PFA for 2 h and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen cooled isopentane. Twelve micrometer of thick sections were obtained at the C5-C6 level and imaged with a Zeiss Axio Observer Microscope at 20X using phase contrast. Ventrolateral and dorsal column white and gray matter were manually outlined for area calculation using Zen Software. Nine images were obtained for each genotype ( 3 sections from 3 spinal cords). Multiple unpaired $t$-test was performed, and plots were generated using GraphPad Prism V9.5.1.\n\n## 2.7 | MRI\n\nHomozygous mice $(n=3)$ were lethally anesthetized with Avertin and perfused transcardially with 10 mL of HBSS followed by 10 mL of $2.5 \\%$ glutaraldehyde, $4 \\%$ PFA at $1 \\mathrm{~mL} / \\mathrm{min}$ as described in Weil et al. (Weil et al., 2019). Brains and spinal cords were post-fixed overnight, and then washed in 1X PBS daily for 7 days. Imaging was performed using the Bruker (Billerica, MA, USA) Pharmascan 7 Tesla, Pre-Clinical MRI system. Multi-echo gradient echo, $T_{2}{ }^{*}$-weighted image volumes ( 2 millisecond first echo time and 2 millisecond echo spacing; 24 echoes; matrix size of $165 \\times 201 \\times 165 ; 100 \\mathrm{um}^{3}$ isotropic resolution) were acquired using a 3D multi-echo gradient-recalled echo (mGRE) sequence with a bipolar readout. For each imaging session, five spinal cords were randomly selected and distributed within a custom-designed receptacle. All spinal cords were imaged within three imaging sessions. Following reconstruction, the image volumes were corrected for bipolar gradient phase offset (Lu et al., 2008) and Gibb's ringing (Kellner et al., 2016). A binary mask for the volume corresponding to C2-C7 of each spinal cord was produced using Otsu's median thresholding method in addition to manual adjustment. The 24 -echo mGRE image volume was decomposed into components corresponding to myelin water, intra/extracellular (IE) water, and free water pools using a self-labeled encoder decoder network (Liu et al., 2022). The myelin water fraction (MWF) was calculated as the ratio of the myelin water pool to the sum of the myelin, IE, and free water pools as previously described (Liu et al., 2022). The MWF was analyzed within the whole spinal cord corresponding to C2-C7. Using GraphPad Prism V9.5.1, one-way ANOVA and Dunnett's multiple comparisons test were performed to evaluate differences in MWF between each genotype. Scattered plots were generated representing \\% MWF for each genotype."

(Weil et al., 2019). For qualitative assessment, image from cervical level spinal cord cross sections of gracile and cuneate (GC), ventromedial (VM), and corticospinal tracts (CST) were obtained. Images also were obtained from the body of the corpus callosum (CC) at midline from 1 mm thick longitudinal brain sections from which samples containing the callosal body were recovered and orientated to yield cross sections.\n\nQuantitative analysis of myelin sheath thickness was performed on images obtained as non-overlapping tiles at 2900x-9300x with fibers segmented using Axondeepseg (Zaimi et al., 2018). Only the subset of fibers with uniformly compact sheaths closely associated with greater than $90 \\%$ of the axon circumference were included in the g-ratios analysis. Two mice from each of the M3KO and M3KOKI lines were analyzed to estimate potential inter-animal variability and, as such variation was negligible, g-ratio analysis was performed on three different tracts from single mice of seven different genotypes at three different ages. Axon and axon plus myelin diameters were calculated from perimeter measurements. Graphs were generated using Microsoft Excel.\n\nTo determine if axon diameters were affected by their myelination status, axons in images of the GC tracts obtained from P30 and P450 mice were selected without regard to myelin morphology, an approach resulting in a population of fibers larger than that selected for g-ratio calculations. All complete axon profiles in the available sets of 20 to 30 non-overlapping 4800x images from each genotype were included in the analysis.\n\nFor g-ratio comparisons, analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) models was performed using R, version 4.3.0, to investigate the possible difference in mean g-ratios between genotypes, after adjusting for axon diameter. Axon diameter range was divided into four bins and ANCOVA was performed to compare each bin with WT. The assumption of homogeneity of linearity for the ANCOVA model was checked by introducing and testing an interaction effect term between genotype and axon diameter. The assumptions of normality and equal variances of errors, as well as the presence of possible outliers, were explored with graphical analysis of residuals. Differences in mean g-ratio were reported with bootstrap $99 \\%$ confidence intervals. Because the experiment was performed using one mouse per genotype, the assumption of independence of observations is violated and the standard errors of the estimates may be biased down and, $p$-values and CIs may therefore be unreliable.\n\n## 2.9 | Sheath lengths in spinal cord white matter\n\nHomozygous mice ( $n=4-5$ ) at P30-31 were anesthetized with a lethal dose of Avertin and perfused transcardially with 10 mL of 1X PBS followed by 10 mL of 4\\% PFA (FDNeuroTechnologies) at $1 \\mathrm{~mL} /$ min. Spinal cord and brain samples were collected and post-fixed in\n4\\% PFA (FDNeuroTechnologies) for 30 min , washed with PBS and stored in PBS at $4^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ before the next step.\n\nVentral and lateral white matter from cervical and thoracic cords were cut into strips and teased apart using acupuncture needles (32 gauge, 0.25 mm diameter, 25 mm length) onto SuperFrost Plus slides (VWR) as described (Jarjour \\& Sherman, 2019). Slides were washed with PBS, pH 7.4, then incubated in blocking solution ( $3 \\%$ normal donkey serum, $2 \\%$ bovine serum albumin, $0.1 \\%$ TritonX-100 in PBS). Nerve fibers were incubated with primary antibodies diluted in blocking solution overnight at room temperature. Primary antibodies were: NFH 1:10,000 (Biolegend \\#822601, RRID: AB_2564859), MAG 1:100 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology sc9544, RRID: AB_670102), Caspr 1:500 (Abcam \\#ab34151, RRID: AB_869934). Slides were washed with blocking solution then incubated 1 h at room temperature in secondary antibodies donkey anti-rabbit AlexaFluor 488, anti-goat AlexaFluor 633 (Invitrogen \\#A21206, \\#A21082, RRID: AB_2535792, AB_2535739) at 1:1000, and donkey anti-chicken DyLight 405 (Jackson ImmunoResearch 703-475-155, RRID:AB_2340373) at 1:500 diluted in blocking solution. Fibers were washed with blocking solution, then PBS, and mounted with Fluoromount G (Southern Biotech) and a glass coverslip.\n\nTiled images were obtained using a Leica SP8 confocal microscope 20x/NA 0.7 objective. Composite z-stack max projections of blinded images were used for analysis in FIJI ImageJ (Schindelin et al., 2012). Complete myelin sheaths were defined as a MAG overlapping NFH with Caspr labeled ends. Sheath lengths were measured from Caspr band to Caspr band. Axon diameters were measured adjacent to the paranode. In regions after the paranode where bulging of myelin sheath was seen adjacent to the paranode, diameter measurements were taken below the uneven section. More than 40 sheaths were measured per mouse of each genotype: M3KO $(n=4)$, M5KO $(n=5)$, M3KO,389bpKI $(n=5)$, and WT mice $(n=5)$. For each genotype, the total number of fibers measured was $>49$ (small diameter), $>200$ (medium diameter), and $>70$ (large diameter). Sample size was pre-determined to give power $>0.8$, sensitive to up to $20 \\%$ changes in myelin sheath length.\n\nUsing GraphPad Prism V9.5.1, one-way ANOVA with Tukey's post hoc analysis was used to determine significance. For representative confocal images in figures, color balance was adjusted to see all channels in the merge.\n\n### 2.10 | Sheath lengths and number in cortex\n\nAnalysis of motor cortex myelin sheaths was performed on 4-5 homozygous mice of each genotype at P30-31 or P85, modified from Swire et al (Swire et al., 2019).

Single cells that had all processes and myelin sheaths fully captured in the $200 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$ thick section were used for analysis of sheath number per individual oligodendrocyte. Seven individual cells per mouse were analyzed. Myelin sheath length defined by CNPase staining between flanking Caspr bands was measured for myelin sheaths completely contained within the vibratome section. A minimum of 204 myelin sheath lengths were measured per animal. Statistical power and sample size were calculated with the G*Power (version 3.1.9.7, Heinrich Heine University Düsseldorf) software. Power of 0.8 and alpha 0.05 , with an effect size of $5 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$ was used.

Slides were cured for at least 24 h and stored at $-20^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$. Confocal images were acquired using a Leica SP8 Spectral Confocal Microscope and Leica LAS X software. Quantification of labeled cells in the dorsal column of the cervical spinal cord were performed using the ImageJ Cell Counter Plugin. Using the \"Freehand selections\" tool, the border of the dorsal column of the cervical spinal was outlined, and the area was acquired using the ImageJ \"Measure\" feature. The readout in square microns was converted to square millimeters before continuing with analysis. Immunoreactive cells within the defined area were marked and counted using the ImageJ Cell Counter Plugin. A minimum of three animals for each genotype and 400 cells for each dorsal column was included in the analysis. Using GraphPad Prism V9.5.1, one-way ANOVA and Dunnett's multiple comparisons test were performed, and plots were generated.\n\n## 3 | RESULTS\n\n### 3.1 | Mutated enhancers affect Golli and Mbp mRNA accumulation throughout the mouse lifespan\n\nAs shown previously, mice bearing different enhancer mutations accumulated line-specific levels of Mbp mRNA in spinal cord that typically followed the normal developmental expression program through P90 (Bagheri et al., 2020). An exception was the newly derived M3KOKI allele that drove expression to levels equal to or higher than WT (160\\% at P30 and 120\\% at P90) (Figure 1a and Supplementary Table S1). In this experimentally derived allele, M3 is replaced by a multimerized M3 sub-sequence (Supplementary Figure S1) that supports two Mbp mRNA accumulation peaks, one typical of WT prior to weaning and a second shortly after (Figure 1a), likely exposing a change in the transcription factor repertoire expressed in oligodendrocytes during primary myelin elaboration and postweaning myelin maintenance. mRNA analysis was extended to P290 in all lines and up to P460 for WT, M3M5KO and M3KOKI mice (Figure 1a and Supplementary Table S1). The inter-line accumulation differences observed for P90 spinal cord largely were maintained through to the oldest age examined. Further, relative Mbp mRNA accumulation in both spinal cord and optic nerve at P30 was similar (Figure 1c).\n\nThe M3 enhancer accounts for $\\sim 40 \\%$ of the Mbp mRNA accumulation in oligodendrocytes. Exceptionally, it also accounts for $\\sim 90 \\%$ of Golli mRNA accumulation in multiple lineages both within and beyond the nervous system (Bagheri et al., 2020; Dib et al., 2011). In contrast, mice bearing the substituted M3KOKI allele accumulated higher Golli levels in spinal cord ( $140 \\%-230 \\%$ ), normal levels in thymus ( $107 \\%$ of WT, data not shown) and exceedingly high levels in P30 optic nerve ( $864 \\%$ of WT)"

Notably, mice entirely null for Golli show delayed myelination and hypomyelination that improves with age (Jacobs et al., 2005). Importantly, myelin disruption in Golli null mice was restricted entirely to the optic system suggesting that our analysis of spinal cord, a domain where the complete absence of Golli has no obvious effect, should not be affected by any reduction in Golli mRNA accumulation. Of most relevance, mice in the M3KO and M5KO lines accumulate the same reduced level of Mbp mRNA but, Golli mRNA is decreased only in M3KO mice. As both M3KO and M5KO mice demonstrated the same myelin phenotypes, reduced Golli mRNA accumulation consequent upon the M3KO deletion has no demonstrable effect on the spinal cord myelin examined in the present study.\n\n## 3.2 | The relationship between the accumulated levels of Mbp mRNA and MBP protein changes with age\n\nEarly pioneering investigations showed that mice bearing combinations of different alleles that included an Mbp encoding transgene, the\n\nMbp null shiverer and myelin deficiency (mld) alleles accumulated Mbp mRNA in the CNS over a wide range that correlated closely with MBP protein levels in the brain (Popko et al., 1987; Shine et al., 1992). To determine if a similar correlation exists in the spinal cord, MBP protein accumulation in the different lines of enhancer-edited mice was measured by Western Blot (WB) and IMS and compared to Mbp mRNA levels.\n\nFor WB analysis, samples from the cervical spinal cord were obtained at P14, near the normal pre-weaning peak of Mbp mRNA accumulation, and at P90, when Mbp mRNA levels have declined to stable levels and myelin is thought to be mature. At P14, a robust correlation between Mbp mRNA and Mbp protein was observed (Figure 2a,b) aligning with previous findings in brain (Popko et al., 1987; Shine et al., 1992). This observation underscores the pivotal role of transcriptional regulation in governing MBP protein levels in young mice. In contrast, at P90, lines with Mbp mRNA levels equal to or above $64 \\%$ of WT (M3KOKI, M3(225)KO, M5KO, and M3KO) accumulated WT MBP protein levels. In the more severely affected M3M5KO and M1EM3M5KO lines (Mbp mRNA levels respectively $38 \\%$ and $25 \\%$ ), MBP levels also improved but did not reach WT levels (Figure 2a-d). Notably, the level of CNPase, an oligodendrocyte protein not prominent in compact myelin (Trapp\n![img-3.jpeg](img-3.jpeg)\n\nFIGURE 2 Relative Myelin basic protein (MBP) levels in spinal cord of enhancer-edited mice as determined by Western blot (WB) and imaging mass spectrometry (IMS).

For IMS, samples obtained at P90, and the intermediate age of P30, showed a trend similar to that revealed by WB. Thus, as mice mature, the close correlation between Mbp mRNA and protein levels is no longer maintained, minimizing the role of transcriptional regulation in governing MBP protein levels.\n\n## 3.3 | White matter volume correlates with Mbp mRNA levels\n\nThe membrane comprising myelin sheaths is atypical as $46 \\%$ of its lipid content is cholesterol (Chrast et al., 2011; Norton \\& Poduslo, 1973). Therefore, as a potential surrogate of relative myelin content, we established the relative levels of cholesterol accumulation in the cervical spinal cord of P90 enhancer-edited mice by both IMS and Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS). In mice with Mbp mRNA levels $64 \\%$ of WT or higher, cholesterol levels in spinal cord white matter were normal, but in those with lower Mbp mRNA levels (M3M5KO and M1EM3M5KO), cholesterol was significantly reduced. To estimate the cholesterol contribution from membrane other than that from compact myelin, we measured cholesterol in the dysmyelinated spinal cord of shiverer mice and found it reduced by 59\\% (IMS) and 37\\% (LC-MS) (Figure 3a-c). The greater reduction in the IMS signal is attributable to its origin exclusively from white matter domains, whereas LC-MS measurements were obtained from spinal cord homogenates containing both white and gray matter.\n\nTo evaluate potential effects of MBP reduction on the relationship between white and gray matter volumes in spinal cord, we evaluated their relative areas in cross-sections of C5-C6 spinal cord at P30. Consistent with the limited density of myelinated fibers in gray matter, Mbp reduction had little effect on the cross-sectional area of that domain. In contrast, white matter area trended lower in M3KO and M5KO and was significantly lower in M3M5KO and M1EM3M5KO mice demonstrating that major changes in spinal cord structure arise from MBP mediated hypomyelination (Figure 3d).\n\nMyelin volumes in C2-C7 spinal cords at P30 also were inferred from MWF measurements obtained by MRI. MWFs computed from multi-echo gradient echo MRI data closely correlated with Mbp mRNA and protein levels and were significantly reduced in all hypomyelinated lines including those with the mildest mRNA reductions (M3KO and M5KO) (Figure 3e,f). It is unknown whether the marked signal reductions in M3KO and M5KO samples reflect a greater capacity of MRI to recognize subtle changes in myelin volume or otherwise undetectable myelin anomalies. Collectively, these findings show that reduced levels of Mbp mRNA and protein have a stepwise effect on myelin volume at young ages.\n\n## 3.4 | Sheath thickness correlates more closely with Mbp mRNA levels in young versus old mice\n\nThe observed myelin volume differences could arise from any combination of reduced sheath thickness or differences in the proportion of\nsuccessfully myelinated axons. To determine how altered Mbp mRNA/protein accumulation affects myelin sheath thickness, EM images from spinal cord and CC were obtained from all lines of enhancer-edited mice. Visual inspection of P30 samples revealed reduced myelin thickness closely correlating with Mbp mRNA level in both the GC and CC (Figure 4a-aa). However, in lines with the smallest Mbp mRNA reductions (M3KO, M5KO and M3(225)KO), myelin thickness increased by P90. No improvement between P30 and P90 was obvious in M3M5KO or M1EM3M5KO mice but, obviously thicker myelin was present in fibers of M3M5KO mice at P450.\n\nTo investigate the axon-myelin relationships in a more quantitative manner we compared $g$-ratios (axon diameter/fiber diameter). Mice of all enhancer-edited genotypes were investigated at P30 and P90 and to evaluate potential age-related changes (Peters, 2002; Peters et al., 2000; Peters et al., 2001), WT, M3KOKI, and M3M5KO mice also were evaluated at P450.\n\nTo investigate possible heterogeneity between sensory and motor fibers, the g-ratios in sensory GC tracts, motor CST, and mixed sensory and motor VM domains were examined. Only fibers free of split myelin and demonstrating close axon association over $>90 \\%$ of the axon circumference were selected for analysis; a circumstance limiting this analysis to axons with diameters ranging from $0.5-3.0 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$ (Figure 4a-u). As replicate samples obtained from M3KO and M3KOKI lines yielded similar g-ratio results, this survey was carried out using samples from one mouse of each genotype and age (Supplementary Figure S2). To represent the g-ratio relationships in the three tracts and three ages examined, results are displayed as bin averages (Figure 5a-c). Also, to display age-related g-ratio changes more clearly, scatter plots of the original data were generated from the selected lines (Figure 5d-f).\n\nAt P30, the most severely affected M1EM3M5KO line ( $15 \\%$ Mbp mRNA) maintained the thinnest sheaths. M3M5KO mice ( $28 \\%$ Mbp mRNA), had modestly thicker sheaths while the more mildly affected M3KO, M5KO and M3(225)KO lines ( $58 \\%-63 \\%$ Mbp mRNA) maintained sheaths that were only slightly thinner than normal. Mice in the over-expressing M3KOKI line ( $160 \\%$ Mbp mRNA) elaborated sheaths that were normal in CST, modestly thicker in VM and slightly thinner in GC (Figure 5a-c). Consequently, the g-ratios in all six enhanceredited lines reflected their relative Mbp mRNA levels.\n\nMbp mRNA accumulation declines in WT and enhancer-edited mice between P30 and P90 following the normal developmental program but at different line-specific levels (Figure 1a). During this period, no obvious changes in myelin thickness occurred in WT mice, but in M3KO, M5KO and M3(225)KO mice sheath thickness improved to approximate the WT value (Figure 5a-f). In the more severely deficient M3M5KO and M1EM3M5KO lines, no similar improvement was obvious at P90. However, while WT g-ratio remained largely unchanged up to P450, modest improvement was apparent in the M3M5KO line. These combined observations demonstrate the existence of an optimal g-ratio that is maintained in WT and suggest that the adult recovery response in hypomyelinated lines is rate-limited by Mbp mRNA availability (Figure 5a-c,f). Curiously, in M3KOKI mice, Mbp mRNA levels were normal at advanced ages (P290 and P460) but axons of all calibers in all tracts were"

A large overlap was observed demonstrating that axon diameters are largely unaffected by Mbp induced changes in myelin thickness in both young and old mice.\n\n## 3.5 | Sheath length is reduced only in mice with severely diminished Mbp mRNA levels\n\nIn addition to axon caliber and myelin thickness, spacing of nodes of Ranvier greatly affects action potential conduction rate (Cohen et al., 2020). Notably, myelin sheaths on large caliber axons are not only thicker but extend along axons for greater distances than those on small caliber axons (Hess \\& Young, 1949; Waxman \\& Sims, 1984). The mechanisms that determine sheath length are yet to be fully characterized, but compelling evidence suggests that nodal spacing can be prefigured on some axons (Vagionitis et al., 2022), while intrinsic oligodendrocyte properties and axon diameter control spacing on others (Bechler et al., 2015). To assess whether internodal distance is affected by reduced Mbp mRNA levels, we investigated teased fibers obtained from spinal cord white matter immunolabeled for markers of myelin, nodes, and paranodes (Figure 6a). Despite the reduced sheath thickness observed at P30 in M3KO and M5KO mice ( $63 \\%$ Mbp mRNA), their sheath lengths were normal on fibers with large, medium, and small calibers. In contrast, the more severe reduction in sheath thickness observed in M3M5KO mice ( $28 \\%$ Mbp mRNA), was associated with an approximately $50 \\%$ reduction in sheath lengths on fibers of all calibers (Figure 6b-e, Supplementary Figure S4). Thus, internodal length is less sensitive to reduced MBP levels than sheath thickness. Further, reduced sheath lengths in M3M5KO mice were associated with abnormalities in nodal and paranodal labeling patterns consistent with overlapping paranodes and trailing paranodal loops (Supplementary Figure S5).\n\nTo investigate the length and number of myelin sheaths elaborated by individual oligodendrocytes, we turned to the sparsely myelinated frontal cortex where oligodendrocytes, along with their full complement of myelin sheaths, can be visualized (Figure 6f). Consistent with the observations on teased spinal cord fibers, the lengths of cortical sheaths were normal in M3KO and M5KO mice but reduced in the more affected M3M5KO line, at both P30 and P85 (Figure 6g,h). As cortical myelin sheaths terminate as heminodes, such shortening is uncomplicated by potential competition from adjacent sheaths. Further, the number of sheaths elaborated by each cortical\noligodendrocyte was normal in all lines including M3M5KO (Figure 6i,j), an observation demonstrating that MBP, a late expressing myelin gene, does not play a role in establishing sheath number.\n\n## 3.6 | Capacity of oligodendrocytes to ensheath axons correlates with Mbp mRNA levels\n\nLike lamellipodia in other cell types, the forward progress of the inner tongues of myelin sheaths requires actin turnover and a role for MBP has been implicated in such actin dynamics (Nawaz et al., 2015; Snaidero et al., 2014; Zuchero et al., 2015). This suggests that low MBP levels could compromise the forward movement of the inner tongue, thus attenuating the capacity of oligodendrocyte membrane to circumnavigate axons resulting in the different $g$-ratios observed in the enhancer-edited lines. Consistent with that model, many axons in Mbp null shiverer mice lack spirally wrapped oligodendrocyte membrane altogether and, when membrane wrapping is present, only a few uncompacted layers are observed (Figures 4i, l,o and 7a,b). To determine if reduced MBP levels also compromise the ability of oligodendrocytes to initiate a myelination program, we searched for the presence of dysmyelinated axons in the different enhancer-edited lines. M1EM3M5KO mice accumulated only $15 \\%$ of the WT Mbp mRNA level at P30 and revealed a sizable subpopulation of entirely dysmyelinated axons across a wide range of calibers (Figure 4s-u). Other axons were associated with sheets of compact myelin that failed to cover the entire axon circumference (Figure 7c) while the remainder were surrounded by uninterrupted, albeit exceptionally thin, compact myelin. However, at mRNA levels $28 \\%$ or above, all caliber-appropriate spinal cord axons appeared to be myelinated (Figure 4j, k, m, n, p,r). Also, in the CC of P30 M1EM3M5KO mice, many caliber-appropriate axons remained unmyelinated (Figure 4z).\n\n## 3.7 | Striking myelin sheath abnormalities correlate with Mbp mRNA levels\n\nIn the developing CNS of young WT mice, myelin sheaths typically display myelinic channels and large microtubule-containing inner tongues but with maturity, these features become less prominent (Snaidero \\& Simons, 2014). In contrast, these features persisted in the markedly hypomyelinated M3M5KO and M1EM3M5KO lines (Figure 7d). Notable in all lines, prominent clusters of radial components traversing myelin sheaths frequently were located where inner\n\nFIGURE 4 EM images from the cervical spinal cords and corpus callosum of enhancer-edited mice.

Rarely, finger-like oligodendrocyte processes protruded into the axon (Figure 7f).\n\nMyelin outfoldings meander between, and often surround, adjacent myelinated axons and are frequently observed in multiple diseases states as well as in normal animals at both preweaning and advanced ages (Erwig et al., 2019; Peters, 2002; Peters et al., 2000; Peters et al., 2001; Snaidero et al., 2014; Sturrock, 1976). In all enhancer-edited mice and WT, myelin outfoldings were rare at P30 and P90 but more common at P450 (Figure 7g,i). Despite the attenuated capacity of M3M5KO mice to elaborate sheaths with normal thickness and length, many fibers had prominent outfoldings of compact myelin with a thickness similar to that part of the sheath surrounding the axon (Figure 7i). This feature limits the nature of the mechanism underlying their appearance with one attractive possibility being shortening of preexisting sheaths without a change in the initial sheath volume. Note that outfoldings arise from sheaths associated with axons across a wide range of calibers.\n\nIn both the spinal cord and CC of M1EM3M5KO mice, a large population of fibers with prominent clusters of membrane tubules were observed ( $75 \\%$ at P30 and 70\\% at P90 of GC fibers) (Figure 7j-l). In both GC and CC, such profiles were encountered less frequently in M3M5KO mice and not all in M3KO and M5KO mice. Notably, they were less frequent in VM and CST, suggesting potential inter-tract heterogeneity.\n\n## 3.8 | Graded changes in myelin elicit stepwise responses in glial cell density\n\nIt is well documented that different glial lineages establish close physical interactions with myelinated fibers extending to synaptic contacts (Rasband \\& Peles, 2016). As previously reported (Bu et al., 2004), we show that the density of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) and postmitotic oligodendrocytes in the dysmyelinated dorsal columns of P80 shiverer mice is respectively, 6 and 3.9 times higher than WT. To determine how this response relates to the degree of hypomyelination, their density was evaluated across the enhancer-edited panel and a closely correlating inverse relationship between density and hypomyelination status was observed. Thus, the mechanism regulating their density is sensitive to even subtle myelin changes (Figure 8a-c). To determine if other glial lineages mount a similar response, the densities of dorsal column astrocytes and microglia were evaluated using Aldh1L1 and Iba1 as respective lineage markers (Figure 8a). Like the oligodendrocyte lineage, astrocyte density also correlated with the extent of hypomyelination (Figure 8d). In contrast, the microglia population remained normal in modestly affected lines, but increased density and morphological changes were observed in\n\nM1EM3M5KO and shiverer mice suggesting that a significant inflammatory response occurs only with severe hypo/dysmyelination (Figure 8e).\n\n## 3.9 | Only mice with the most severely reduced Mbp mRNA level exhibit abnormal behavior and shortened lifespan\n\nThe enhancer-edited mice were established through backcrosses to C57BI/6 and are maintained as homozygotes. Mice in five of the six lines were indistinguishable from WT by in-cage behavior, reproductive capacity, life span, and body weights thus minimizing the possibility of secondary effects on myelin phenotypes (Supplementary Figure S6). However, M1EM3M5KO mice, that accumulated the lowest mRNA level, demonstrated a mild shiverer-like phenotype initiating around P18 along with frequent seizures after maturity. While their body weights were lower at older ages, and their lifespan reduced to approximately 9 months, their reproductive capacity was not compromised. F1 offspring from a cross between M3M5KO and M1EM3M5KO are predicted to accumulate an intermediate Mbp mRNA level and had a normal lifespan and demonstrated subtle shivering and rare seizures only when young.\n\n## 4 | DISCUSSION\n\nOur observations on young enhancer-edited mice demonstrated a close correlation between myelin sheath thickness and Mbp mRNA and protein accumulation. We show here that such correlations extend to myelin volume measurements including the area of white matter tracts, cholesterol content, and MWF. We also show that severely reduced Mbp mRNA levels diminished the capacity to initiate sheath elaboration and the ability to extend sheathes longitudinally. Also correlating with Mbp mRNA levels was the presence of prominent myelin-associated membrane tubule clusters. Unexpectedly, we also show that initially hypomyelinated sheaths improve or normalize with age, further defining the dynamic nature of myelin in the mature CNS. Such plasticity is played out over a protracted period when stable and low levels of Mbp mRNA are maintained, with the actual rate of improvement correlating with line specific Mbp mRNA levels. While, these observations imply engagement of a post-transcriptional mechanism, defining the precise roles played by transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms is precluded due to the long half-life of MBP protein sequestered in myelin sheaths (Meschkat et al., 2022) and the unknown stability of RNP-associated Mbp mRNA. It also is unclear if the Mbp mRNA level existing at the\n\nFIGURE 5 Spinal cord g-ratio in sensory, motor and mixed tracts from enhancer-edited mice at different ages.

That relationship was inferred from Mbp mRNA levels\nat a young age (P18) and MBP protein measured at maturity (P60). However, the sequence of the Mbp transgene used in those studies is now known to lack both the M3 and M5 oligodendrocyte enhancers that are major contributors to Mbp expression. Consequently, the actual level of Mbp mRNA that arose in the P60 brain from the randomly inserted transgene on a mixed genetic background is unknown. Therefore, a direct comparison with the present results cannot be made leaving open the possibility that the earlier"

As sheaths with vastly different volumes exist on small vs large caliber axons, it remains an enigma how reduced Mbp transcription could affect sheath dimensions on all axons in an apparently equivalent manner.

      "markdown": "the myelin sheath prior to translation (Barbarese et al., 1995; Carson et al., 2001), two general mechanisms are suggested. Either different concentrations of Mbp mRNA are recruited to individual sheaths or uniformly distributed Mbp mRNA is translated with different efficiencies depending upon axon caliber. Supporting the potential importance of mRNA transport, numerous microtubule-disrupting mutants result in hypomyelination (Duncan et al., 2017; Fu et al., 2019; Herbert et al., 2017; Lyons et al., 2009; Seiberlich et al., 2015). Regardless, both models depend upon signals to the myelin sheath that must originate locally from the ensheathed axon.\n\nOur observations arise directly from the experimentally imposed changes in Mbp mRNA accumulation. While the minimum concentration of MBP required to compact spirally wrapped oligodendrocyte membrane into myelin sheaths remains known, the correlation observed here between sheath dimensions and Mbp mRNA levels supports the view that all compact myelin, regardless of its normal or hypomyelinated state, has an equivalent concentration of MBP. A similar stoichiometry was observed for myelin physically isolated from $\\mathrm{mld} / \\mathrm{mld}$ mice (Roch et al., 1987).\n\nIn all mouse lines in which the M3 enhancer was edited or deleted, Golli mRNA accumulation was abnormal (Bagheri et al., 2020; Dib et al., 2011). As the total lack of Golli disrupts myelin formation on fibers serving the optic system (Jacobs et al., 2005), its widespread disruption in the M3-deleted lines might contribute to the observed myelin phenotypes thus complicating interpretation of the present results. However, M3KO and M5KO mice accumulated similar levels of Mbp mRNA, and achieved equivalent myelin phenotypes despite the major reduction in Golli mRNA accumulation that occured only in M3KO mice; an observation that rules out any contribution of the Golli mRNA reduction to the spinal cord myelin phenotypes reported here. Nonetheless, Golli overexpression in M3KO389bpKI mice (145\\% of WT) could potentially contribute to the hypermyelination observed in such mice at P450, an age when Mbp mRNA has returned to WT levels.\n\nOur observations on myelin sheath thickness in the enhanceredited mice are accommodated by the current model of sheath formation in which the lamellapodia-like inner tongue circumnavigates the axon to deposit spirally wrapped layers of oligodendrocyte plasma membrane (Snaidero \\& Simons, 2014). Traditionally, MBP was thought to compact and stabilize myelin but more recently, a capacity to modulate cytoskeleton dynamics also was recognized. Consequently, in its absence or reduced concentration, inner tongue function could be compromised (Zuchero et al., 2015). Consistent with MBP playing a critical role in lamellipodia function, massive clusters of small tubular membrane profiles are interspersed between the dysmyelinated axons of Mbp null shiverer mice. Similar clusters were a notable feature of many fibers in the most severely hypomyelinated lines (M3M5KO and M1EM3M5KO) but were not observed in M3KO and M5KO mice ( $63 \\%$ of WT). In hypomyelinated fibers, such structures typically extend directly from regions of compact myelin lamellae providing further insight into their origin.\n\nIn addition to the effects of altered Mbp mRNA on myelin formation, the densities of OPCs, oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, and\nmicroglia increased relative to hypomyelination severity. These secondary responses could be directed by the hypomyelinated fibers themselves or mediated through interactions among the different glial lineages, as seen with the response of OPCs to activated microglia (Hughes \\& Appel, 2020; McNamara et al., 2023; Santos \\& Fields, 2021; Sherafat et al., 2021; Traiffort et al., 2020). As revealed by the stepwise response across the enhancer-edited lines, the underlying mechanism affecting OPCs, oligodendrocytes and astrocytes is exquisitely sensitive to very small differences in MBP levels and/or myelin dimensions.\n\nMarked heterogeneity has emerged among different oligodendrocyte populations (Bechler et al., 2015; Gargareta et al., 2022; Marques et al., 2016; Seeker et al., 2023; Spassky et al., 1998) thus putting the generalizability of observations on spinal cord to other CNS domains in doubt. However, in the distinctly different spinal cord and cortical domains, altered Mbp mRNA levels affected myelin sheath lengths equivalently and alterations in sheath thickness were largely equivalent in motor and sensory tracts in the spinal cord. Nonetheless, intertract changes in g-ratios were observed in those lines in which the M3 enhancer was edited to reduce its complement of conserved transcription factor binding sites. As similar inter-tract heterogeneity was realized by reporter constructs similarly regulated by M3 subsequences, such differences might reflect heterogeneity in the transcription factor repertoire expressed by oligodendrocytes in different tracts. The exceptionally high Golli mRNA accumulation observed in the optic nerve of M3KOKI mice is one striking example of such domain-specific heterogeneity.\n\nMice in the enhancer-edited lines are long-lived with typical reproductive capacity. In all but one line, no remarkable in-cage behaviors nor obvious progressive pathology was observed. These readily accessible mice and their initial characterization, as provided here, should facilitate investigations on diverse aspects of the myelination program (Liu et al., 2022) that operates over the course of the mouse lifespan.\n\n## AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS\n\nH.
