We determined RB hotspots indicated by consecutive associated windows. We subsequently compared the top 20\\% of ASD-related RB hotspots with those for SCZ, and with regions where recurrent pathogenic CNVs occur, using permutation to test for significance. We used enrichment analyses to explore the function of the overlapping hotspots for ASD and SCZ ( $10 \\%$ of the genome).\nResults: We found similar results for ASD as for SCZ reported in our initial study for 22q11.21 ( $\\mathrm{OR}=2, \\mathrm{p}=0.005$ ). The RB-hotspots for ASD overlapped with hotspots for SCZ ( $p$ $<1 \\mathrm{e}-19$ ) and pathogenic CNVs ( $p<1 \\mathrm{e}-09$ ). The overlapping hotspots for ASD and SCZ were highly enriched for evolutionary constrained transcriptional factors ( $p<1 \\mathrm{e}-99$ ), suggesting implication of these regions in genome regulation.\nDiscussion: Our findings show that the RB analysis generates meaningful results when applied to ASD, adding to our previous observations in SCZ. We show that genomic regions most vulnerable for the cumulative regional impact multiple sequence level variants strongly overlap with regions of recurrent pathogenic CNVs. We also show significant overlap with previously identified RB-hotspots for SCZ. The genomic regions where the RB has the strongest impact on ASD and SCZ risk are strongly enriched for transcription factors suggestion a role in genome regulation. The question raised by these results is how evolutionary strongly constrained noncoding DNA sequences are implicated in the risk for two uniquely human conditions, ASD and SCZ. Our findings suggest that RB analysis is a novel tool that may contribute to the elucidation of genomic regions influencing vulnerability for ASD and SCZ.\n\nDisclosure: Nothing to Disclose.\ndoi: 10.1016/j.euroneuro.2023.08.243\n\n## W56. UNRAVELING THE IMPACT OF GENOMIC VARIATIONS ON COGNITIVE ABILITY ACROSS THE HUMAN CORTEX: INSIGHTS FROM GENE EXPRESSION AND COPY NUMBER VARIANTS\n\nKuldeep Kumar ${ }^{1}$, Sayeh Kazem ${ }^{1}$, Guillaume Huguet ${ }^{1}$, Thomas Renne ${ }^{1}$, Bank Engchuan ${ }^{2}$, Omar Shanta ${ }^{3}$, Bhooma Thiruvahindrapuram ${ }^{2}$, Jeff MacDonald ${ }^{2}$, Marieke Klein ${ }^{3}$, Stephen Scherer ${ }^{2}$, Laura Almasy ${ }^{4}$, Jonathan Sebat ${ }^{3}$, David Glahn ${ }^{5}$, Guillaume Dumas ${ }^{1}$, SÃ©bastien Jacquemont ${ }^{1}$<br>${ }^{1}$ University of Montreal; ${ }^{2}$ Hospital for Sick Children; ${ }^{3}$ University of California; ${ }^{4}$ Childrens Hospital of Philadelphia; ${ }^{5}$ Harvard Medical School/Boston Children's Hospital\n\nBackground: Relating behavior to inter-individual genetic variation and changes in transcription across the cortex remains a key question in neuroscience. Genomic deletions and duplications - copy number variants (CNVs) - increase the risk for psychiatric conditions and decrease cognitive ability in the general population. Deletions and duplications\nfully encompassing one or more genes, invariably lead to opposing effects on transcription in the brain. Whether the effects of CNVs on cognition are linked to where gene expression is altered in the cortex has not been investigated. We aim to map the effects of CNVs on cognitive ability across the human cortex.\nMethods: To achieve this, we analyzed measures of cognitive abilities and CNV calls ( $>50$ kilobases) in over 259,000 individuals from unselected populations (CARTaGEN, Generation Scotland, IMAGEN, Lothian Birth Cohort, Saguenay Youth Study, and UK Biobank). We i) assigned 16,000 coding genes to 180 cortical brain regions of the Glasser parcellation based on their preferential expression across the human cortex of healthy adults provided by the Allen Human Brain Atlas (AHBA); and ii) performed a brain-based GWAS: 180 burden association analyses (linear models) estimating the mean effect size on cognitive ability of genes altered by CNVs for each of the cortical regions, for deletions and duplications separately.\nResults: Results show that when affected by CNVs, $71 \\%$ and $62 \\%$ of the 180 cortical brain region gene sets were associated with a significant (Bonferroni) decrease in cognitive ability for deletions and duplications respectively. The spatial pattern of effect sizes was negatively correlated between deletions and duplications. Both maps also correlated with the well-established cytoarchitectural and functional gradient of the human cortex. The largest effect sizes for deletions and duplications were observed for gene sets preferentially expressed in sensorimotor and association regions respectively. Stratifying genes based on intolerance to loss of function (3 non-overlapping groups) resulted in larger effect sizes for intolerant compared to tolerant genes. However, the same significant anticorrelated deletion-duplication patterns were observed across all 3 groups, demonstrating that this cortical gradient of effect size is orthogonal to dosage-sensitivity scores. Results were also robust to stratification across tissue-specificity, cell types, and developmental epochs, and were replicated in an independent gene expression dataset (Human Protein Atlas).\nDiscussion: We delineate for the first time a novel functional axis across the cortex, which dissociates the effects of deletions and duplications (effectively a decrease or an increase in transcription) on cognitive ability.\n\nDisclosure: Nothing to Disclose.\ndoi: 10.1016/j.euroneuro.2023.08.244\n\n## W57.
