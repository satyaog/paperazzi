We aimed to systematically review the magnitude and duration of the protective effectiveness of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection and hybrid immunity against infection and severe disease caused by the omicron variant.\n\nMethods For this systematic review and meta-regression, we searched for cohort, cross-sectional, and case-control studies in MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, ClinicalTrials.gov, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, the WHO COVID-19 database, and Europe PubMed Central from Jan 1, 2020, to June 1, 2022, using keywords related to SARS-CoV-2, reinfection, protective effectiveness, previous infection, presence of antibodies, and hybrid immunity. The main outcomes were the protective effectiveness against reinfection and against hospital admission or severe disease of hybrid immunity, hybrid immunity relative to previous infection alone, hybrid immunity relative to previous vaccination alone, and hybrid immunity relative to hybrid immunity with fewer vaccine doses. Risk of bias was assessed with the Risk of Bias In Non-Randomized Studies of Interventions Tool. We used log-odds randomeffects meta-regression to estimate the magnitude of protection at 1-month intervals. This study was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42022318605).\n\nFindings 11 studies reporting the protective effectiveness of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection and 15 studies reporting the protective effectiveness of hybrid immunity were included. For previous infection, there were 97 estimates ( 27 with a moderate risk of bias and 70 with a serious risk of bias). The effectiveness of previous infection against hospital admission or severe disease was $74-6 \\%$ ( $95 \\%$ CI $63-1-83-5$ ) at 12 months. The effectiveness of previous infection against reinfection waned to $24-7 \\%$ ( $95 \\%$ CI $16-4-35-5$ ) at 12 months. For hybrid immunity, there were 153 estimates ( 78 with a moderate risk of bias and 75 with a serious risk of bias). The effectiveness of hybrid immunity against hospital admission or severe disease was $97-4 \\%$ ( $95 \\%$ CI $91-4-99-2$ ) at 12 months with primary series vaccination and $95-3 \\%$ ( $81-9-98-9$ ) at 6 months with the first booster vaccination after the most recent infection or vaccination. Against reinfection, the effectiveness of hybrid immunity following primary series vaccination waned to $41-8 \\%$ ( $95 \\%$ CI $31-5-52-8$ ) at 12 months, while the effectiveness of hybrid immunity following first booster vaccination waned to $46-5 \\%(36-0-57-3)$ at 6 months.\n\nInterpretation All estimates of protection waned within months against reinfection but remained high and sustained for hospital admission or severe disease. Individuals with hybrid immunity had the highest magnitude and durability of protection, and as a result might be able to extend the period before booster vaccinations are needed compared to individuals who have never been infected.\n\nFunding WHO COVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations.\nCopyright (c) 2023 World Health Organization; licensee Elsevier.

We searched MEDLINE (Ovid), Embase (Ovid), Web of Science (Core Collection), ClinicalTrials.gov, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (Ovid), the WHO COVID-19 database, and Europe PubMed Central (limited to preprints) from Jan 1, 2020, to June 1, 2022, with keywords related to SARS-CoV-2, reinfection, protective effectiveness, previous infection, presence of antibodies, and hybrid immunity. We found a few systematic reviews that incorporated data on the omicron variant, but none that examined protection against the omicron variant conferred by hybrid immunity (ie, immunity gained from the combination of vaccination and previous infection), which is now widespread globally. One review reported the duration and magnitude of protection from previous infection over time; however, to the best of our knowledge, no study has systematically compared the magnitude and duration of protection from vaccination, previous infection, and hybrid immunity. A large study in Qatar reported that protection from infection or hybrid immunity against the omicron variant wanes to low levels at 15 months but is relatively stable against severe disease.\n\n## Added value of this study\n\nPrevious SARS-CoV-2 infection and hybrid immunity both provided greater and more sustained protection against the omicron variant than vaccination alone. Individuals with hybrid immunity had the highest magnitude and durability of protection against all outcomes; protection against severe disease remained higher than $95 \\%$ until the end of available follow-up at 11 months after hybrid immunity with primary series vaccination and 4 months after hybrid immunity with booster vaccination, and was sustained at these high levels of\nprotection in projections to 12 months after primary series hybrid immunity and 6 months after booster vaccination hybrid immunity.\n\n## Implications of all the available evidence\n\nThese results provide information that can be used to tailor guidance on the number and timing of SARS-CoV-2 vaccinations. At the public health level, these findings can be combined with data on local infection prevalence, vaccination rates, and their timing. In settings with high seroprevalence, scarce resources, and competing health priorities, evidence suggests that it is reasonable to focus on achieving high coverage rates with primary series vaccination among individuals who are at higher risk of poor outcomes, as this will provide a high level of protection against severe disease for at least 1 year among those with previous infection. Furthermore, given the waning protection for both infection-induced and vaccine-induced immunity against SARS-CoV-2 infection or reinfection, wider vaccination among populations (eg, mass vaccination) could be timed for rollout before periods of expected increased incidence, such as the winter season. At the individual level, these results can be combined with knowledge of a person's infection and vaccination history. A 6-month delay in a booster dose might be justified after the last infection or vaccination for individuals with a known history of previous infection and full primary series vaccination. Further follow-up data on the protective effectiveness of hybrid immunity against hospital admission or severe disease for all vaccines are needed to clarify how much waning of protection might occur with a longer duration since the last infection or vaccination. Producing estimates of protection for vaccines targeting new variants will be crucial for COVID-19 vaccination policy and decision-making bodies. Policy makers considering the use and timing of vaccinations could include the local extent of past infection, the protection conferred by previous infection or hybrid immunity, and the duration of this protection as key considerations to inform their decision making.\n\nGermany (V Piechotta PhD); International Vaccine Access Center, Department of International Health, John Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA (M M Higdon MPH); Department of Immunizations, Vaccines and Biologicals, World Health Organization, Geneva, Switzerland (Prof A Wilder-Smith MD, D R Feikin MD, M K Patel MD); Heidelberg Institute of Global Health, University of Heidelberg, Germany (Prof A Wilder-Smith); Institute of Biomedical Engineering, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK (R K Anira)\nCorrespondence to:\nDr Niklas Bobrovitz, Ternerty Faculty of Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON M5S 1AR, Canada\nniklas.bobrovitz@mail. otoronto.ca\nof SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccination), varying rates and timings of past infection and vaccination, multiple types of vaccination and numbers of doses, and variants of concern that can escape pre-existing immunity. ${ }^{1,4}$\nSystematic reviews of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine effectiveness studies have provided clarity on the durability of protection for different variants of concern. ${ }^{1,6}$ These studies have compared protection among vaccinated individuals to that in unvaccinated individuals and compared protection between different numbers of doses. However, there are gaps in the literature on the magnitude and duration of protection conferred by previous infection, both among individuals who have not been vaccinated (ie, the effectiveness of previous infection alone) and among individuals who have been\nvaccinated (ie, the effectiveness of hybrid immunity). A systematic review has estimated the durability of protection conferred by previous infection. ${ }^{7}$ However, no systematic review has, to the best of our knowledge, estimated the durability of protection conferred by hybrid immunity or compared the durability of the different types of protection.\nWe aimed to systematically review the evidence for the magnitude and duration of the effectiveness of previous infection and hybrid immunity against multiple clinical outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infection caused by the omicron variant. We also aimed to examine the comparative protection of hybrid immunity relative to previous infection only, vaccination only, and hybrid immunity with fewer vaccine doses."

The search strategy comprised three keyword concepts: SARS-CoV-2; reinfection and protective effectiveness; and previous infection, presence of antibodies, and hybrid immunity. We also sought article recommendations from authors of previous vaccine effectiveness studies and WHO Solidarity II network investigators.\n\nScreening was done in Covidence software with titles and abstracts and full-text manuscripts. Two reviewers independently screened studies (NB, XM, ZL, RH, CC, AS, HI, BC). Conflicts were resolved by a third reviewer (NB, XM).\n\nDetailed inclusion and exclusion criteria are reported in the appendix (pp 10-12). We included studies examining protection against reinfection with the omicron variant, in which the exposure group was people with previous infection with any SARS-CoV-2 variant or hybrid immunity and the control group was immune-naive individuals, previously infected individuals, or previously vaccinated individuals. Infection due to the omicron variant was determined by genomic sequencing or inferred on the basis of time periods when the variants were predominant according to the GISAID (Global Initiative on Sharing Avian Influenza Data) EpiFlu database. Studies were excluded if they did not report evidence of previously confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases or did not report the period of time between the index infection and reinfection.\n\n## Outcome definition and comparison groups\n\nSARS-CoV-2 reinfection was defined as a possible, probable, or confirmed reinfection case according to adapted WHO definitions (appendix p 10). ${ }^{10}$ Partial primary series and full primary series vaccination were defined according to the original clinical trials of the respective COVID-19 vaccines. First booster vaccination included individuals at least 7 days from receipt of the first booster dose.\n\nEstimates of vaccine effectiveness (ie, vaccinated $v$ s unvaccinated) against the omicron variant were obtained from the dataset of a systematic review and metaregression involving 19 studies of both primary series and booster vaccination (of which 18 were primary series studies and 12 were first booster studies). ${ }^{4}$ This previous\n\nFor more on the GISAID EpiFlu database see https://www. re7data.org/repository/ (3d100010126\nsystematic review ${ }^{6}$ used similar inclusion and exclusion criteria to our analysis. We applied our meta-regression model to the dataset to project the trends of waning vaccine effectiveness, in parallel with trends for previous infection and hybrid immunity generated from data procured in our systematic review (appendix pp 12-13).\n\n## Data analysis\n\nSummary data were extracted from published reports by one reviewer and verified by a second reviewer (NB, XM, ZL, RH, CC, and AS). We extracted data for each outcome (infection [asymptomatic or symptomatic disease], hospital admission, or severe disease [a combination of the WHO definitions of severe, critical, or fatal COVID-19]), ${ }^{11}$ stratifying by age, sex, vaccine type, the variant of concern causing the index infection, and the severity of the index infection (appendix pp 10-13). Few studies reported ethnicity data, so we were unable to analyse the impact of ethnicity on our study outcomes.\n\nRisk of bias was assessed with the Risk of Bias In NonRandomized Studies of Interventions (ROBINS-I) Tool. ${ }^{12}$ Two reviewers (NB and VP) independently completed the assessments for each reported outcome. Conflicts were resolved by discussion and consensus among the two authors.\n\nFive effect measures of protection were calculated on the basis of different comparisons of immune status: the protective effectiveness of previous infection (defined as previous infection vs immune naive); the protective effectiveness of hybrid immunity (defined as hybrid immunity vs immune naive); the comparative protective effectiveness of hybrid immunity relative to previous infection alone (defined as hybrid immunity vs infection); the comparative protective effectiveness of hybrid immunity relative to previous vaccination alone (defined as hybrid immunity vs previous vaccination); and the comparative protective effectiveness of hybrid immunity relative to hybrid immunity with fewer vaccine doses (defined as hybrid immunity with more vaccine doses vs hybrid immunity with fewer vaccine doses). The immunity comparisons, effect measures, and their epidemiological importance are described in the appendix (p 13). The primary outcomes were the abovementioned five measures of protection against hospital admission due to COVID-19 or severe disease at discrete timepoints. The secondary outcomes were the same five measures of protection against infection with the omicron variant at discrete timepoints. For previous infection, we used estimates starting from 2 months after the primary infection, reflecting the length of time required for a possible reinfection. For hybrid immunity, we used estimates starting from 2 months after the primary infection or at least 7 days after the most recent vaccination (the cutoff threshold varied by vaccine according to the original clinical trials; appendix pp 10-11).\n\nUsing the log-odds meta-regression model, we generated estimates of effectiveness in successive months"

In general, hybrid immunity with a greater number of vaccinations\nconferred significant gains in protection against both hospital admission or severe disease and reinfection; however, data were scarce for some comparisons (table 3).\n\nOne cohort study of 38 older adults (aged 71-101 years) done in France ${ }^{19}$ reported the comparative protective effectiveness of hybrid immunity with the first booster vaccination series relative to the first booster vaccination only with the BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) or mRNA-1273 (Moderna) vaccines.

Vaccine effectiveness data were procured from a separate systematic review.\n[54-5-73-6]; figure 3; appendix p 52). Against reinfection at 6 months, there was a similar protection conferred by hybrid immunity with the first booster vaccination ( $46-5 \\%$ [ $95 \\%$ CI $36-0-57-3]$ ), hybrid immunity with the primary series ( $60-4 \\%$ [49-6-70-3]), and previous infection alone ( $51-2 \\%$ [38-6-63-7]), with all three types of immunity conferring significantly greater protection than primary series vaccination alone ( $15-1 \\%$ [11-3-19-8]) or first booster vaccination alone ( $24-8 \\%$ [18-5-32-5]; figure 3; appendix p 52).\n\n## Discussion\n\nThis systematic review and meta-regression found that both previous infection alone and previous infection combined with previous vaccination (ie, hybrid immunity) conferred rapidly waning protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection with the omicron variant, but high and sustained protection against hospital admission or severe disease due to the omicron variant. Previous infection was found to provide higher protection against reinfection and more sustained protection against hospital admission or severe disease than vaccination alone. However, individuals with hybrid immunity had the highest magnitude and durability of protection against all outcomes, emphasising the importance of providing vaccination to previously infected individuals.\nAnother systematic review similarly reported rapid waning of protection against infection with the omicron variant, but was unable to infer protection against severe disease over time and did not examine hybrid immunity.7 Previous studies have similarly reported that previous infection confers more durable protection than vaccination. ${ }^{31}$ This pattern might be explained by natural infection invoking a more diverse immune response to multiple antigenic sites on the virus compared to the immunity developed through vaccines that target only spike antigens.\nProtection from previous infection should not detract from the need for vaccination. Infection-induced protection against reinfection wanes rapidly, and vaccination increases durability. Furthermore, there are serious risks associated with infection. These include the risks of hospital admission, ICU admission and mechanical ventilation, and death; they also include the risk of developing post-COVID-19 complications. Additionally, those who recover from severe COVID-19 have a higher risk of cardiovascular complications, neurological complications, dementia, diabetes, and chronic respiratory problems. ${ }^{32,33}$ Vaccination is therefore a safe intervention to avert severe disease outcomes and to reduce post-COVID-19 complications. ${ }^{34}$ Reassuringly, vaccination after natural infection is not thought to be associated with an increased risk of reactogenicity or other safety concerns. ${ }^{35}$\nAt the individual level, our results show that the need for, and optimal timing of, the primary vaccination series and booster dose might be different in an individual who has previously had SARS-CoV-2 infection or who has had a breakthrough infection after initiation of the primary series compared to a previously uninfected individual. Our findings are in line with a recent study that reported a higher quality and magnitude of immune responses (antibodies and B cells) with a longer interval between infection and booster vaccination (>180 days). ${ }^{36}$ It might therefore be reasonable for individuals with a previous infection and full primary series vaccination to delay subsequent doses of vaccination by 6 months, while still maintaining high levels of protection against severe disease.\nOn a population level, the optimal number of vaccine doses and the inter-dose interval might differ in settings with various degrees of vaccine-induced versus infectioninduced immunity. However, well designed serosurveys are required for estimating infection-induced seroprevalence rates and reliable estimates can only be generated in countries where inactivated vaccines were not used. Considering this caveat, basing national vaccination policies on infection-induced seroprevalence rates could be challenging in many settings.\nIn countries where only S-protein antigen vaccines were used, it might be possible to classify individuals as previously infected with an anti-N antibody test and use this to modify recommendations for boosters. However, this approach might not be reasonable for high-risk groups, including older people and immunocompromised individuals, since our data were not stratified by patient demographics. Caution is also required as programmatic vaccine rollout should be as simple as possible; modifying the number of vaccines and intervals by infection-induced seroprevalence rates could complicate vaccine programmes and thus hamper vaccine uptake. Furthermore, prevaccination screening for past infections is not recommended by WHO, ${ }^{37}$ similar to other mass vaccination programmes (eg, measles) where past infections are not a reason to exclude individuals from vaccination or delay vaccination. Additionally, there might still be benefit in providing boosters before periods with expected increased incidence, such as the winter season, to individuals whose"

In fact, this scenario is common as the prevalence of infection has been largely underestimated in most settings throughout the pandemic. ${ }^{3}$\n\nOur systematic review had several potential limitations. First, the patterns of declining protection observed in this study might be explained by waning immunity; however, these results could also be in part attributable to unmeasured biases. The observational studies we included assumed that all individuals had the same risk of exposure. However, differential depletion of susceptibles bias could have occurred, where, when the vaccine is effective, people who are infected are more likely to be unvaccinated than vaccinated, thus reducing the proportion of susceptible individuals in the unvaccinated group and creating the appearance of waning. ${ }^{18}$ Exposure could also differ between groups, as in the case of individuals who are unvaccinated because they are severely immunocompromised, and thus also have a greater risk of infection. The likelihood of measuring an outcome could also differ between groups (eg, individuals with no previously reported infection who might not have had access to testing). Individual studies adjusted for some of these factors (eg, calendar time, age, comorbidities, and testing frequency) and these adjustments were considered in the risk of bias assessment; however, not all studies reported these adjustments. Second, our analysis did not incorporate the sequence of and timing between vaccination and previous infection for hybrid immunity. Nine studies reported information on the sequence of immunological challenges; however, the data were spread across different types of exposures (eg, hybrid immunity with different numbers of vaccine doses) and sequence permutations. Data from studies measuring neutralising antibodies suggest that the sequence and timing of immunological challenges could interact with the level of protection conferred, ${ }^{36,39}$ but further studies with linked individuallevel data are needed. Third, data were scarce for some analyses, which implies the need for caution in interpretation of results, particularly for estimates of the comparative protective effectiveness of hybrid immunity relative to vaccination, estimates by vaccination type, and estimates by the variant causing the primary infection. Scarce data also precluded stratified analyses by age, sex, ethnicity, severity of primary infection, and protection against the distinct omicron subvariants. Stratifications by participant demographic characteristics were often omitted by researchers and should be consistently reported. Fourth, in the 11 studies reporting data based on multiple vaccines, the relative proportions of individuals vaccinated by each product was unclear, complicating our ability to generate estimates specific to vaccine brands. Fifth, the vaccine effectiveness data were procured from a separate systematic review. However, the inclusion and exclusion criteria were similar to our study. Furthermore, we re-analysed the raw data using\nthe same method that was used for the data on previous infection and hybrid immunity. Sixth, we were only able to examine protection conferred by pre-omicron SARS-CoV-2 variants (ie, the index virus through to the delta [B.1.617.2] variant). Future evidence synthesis will be needed to ascertain the protection conferred by the omicron variant against reinfection.\nOur findings make clear the substantial durability of hybrid immunity and could help inform the timing and prioritisation of vaccination programmes in populations with high rates of past infection. Further follow-up is needed to assess the protective effectiveness of hybrid immunity against hospital admission or severe disease, the two outcomes that drive most COVID-19 policy decisions, to clarify how much waning of protection might occur over a longer duration, especially if new variants of concern emerge. More precise quantification of the duration of this protection will help inform the necessity and timing of future booster vaccinations. Policy makers can use these findings to project population protection from local vaccination and seroprevalence rates, helping to inform the use and timing of COVID-19 vaccination as an important public health tool.\n\n## Contributors\n\nNB, LAR, DLB, IB, RKA, AWS, DF, MKP, LS, and MDVK were responsible for conceptualisation of the study.
