While broad categories of astrocytic structures are known, the discrete building blocks that compose them, along with their geometry and organizing principles, are poorly understood. Quantitative investigation of astrocytic complexity is impeded by the absence of high-resolution datasets and robust computational approaches to analyze these intricate cells. To address this, we produced four ultra-high-resolution datasets of mouse cerebral cortex using serial electron microscopy and developed astrocyte-tailored computer vision methods for accurate structural analysis. We unearthed specific anatomical building blocks, structural motifs, connectivity hubs, and hierarchical organizations of astrocytes. Furthermore, we found that astrocytes interact with discrete clusters of synapses and that astrocytic mitochondria are distributed to lie closer to larger clusters of synapses. Our findings provide a geometrically principled, quantitative understanding of astrocytic nanoarchitecture and point to an unexpected level of complexity in how astrocytes interact with CNS microanatomy.\n\n## INTRODUCTION\n\nAstrocytes are essential regulators of central nervous system (CNS) development and function. They play vital roles in processes ranging from respiration to memory recall. ${ }^{1}$ The functional versatility of astrocytes stems from their anatomical complexity and ability to integrate signals from most CNS cell types/structures, including neurons and vasculature. Gray matter astrocytes are believed to have a \"sponge-like\" anatomy, with perforations forming holes and loops. ${ }^{2}$ It is also thought that astrocytic processes form progressively smaller elements termed branches, branchlets, and leaflets. ${ }^{3-5}$ However, a deeper quantitative analysis of astrocytic structure is required to understand how their complex architecture enables such specialized and diverse physiological roles. ${ }^{6,7}$ Higher-resolution datasets and methodologies that can effectively interrogate the complex geometry and architecture of astrocytes are needed.\n\nThe convoluted processes that make up an astrocyte's structure can be as thin as 10 nm and fall below the detection limits by confocal and super-resolution microscopy, ${ }^{6,8}$ necessitating electron microscopy and serial sectioning at extremely thin\nslicing intervals. ${ }^{9,10}$ However, astrocytes can be up to $100 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$ in diameter. This range in scale makes wholistic studies of astrocytic structure difficult. One readily identifiable astrocytic structure is the perisynaptic astrocytic process (PAP), which interacts with and regulates synapses. ${ }^{11}$ PAPs are assumed to occur at branch tips, where they detect synaptic activity ${ }^{12}$ and possibly deliver neuroactive molecules such as ATP, glutamate, and D-serine. ${ }^{13}$ However, whether PAPs have unique structural properties is unknown. Defining such anatomical features will aid the understanding of how astrocytes interact with synapses to regulate synaptic transmission. Astrocytes also have specialized endfeet (EF) that ensheath neurovasculature to support blood-brain-barrier (BBB) maintenance and neurovascular coupling. ${ }^{14,15}$ However, a complete and quantitative picture of this distinctive structure is lacking.\n\nHere, we deployed astrocyte-tailored computer vision methods on new high-resolution datasets to make accurate structural measurements of astrocytes. Using geometric measures, we decompose astrocytes into previously unnoticed building blocks, which we term constrictions, expansions, and cores. We show that these building blocks are assembled into"

We also show that astrocytes partition the neuropil, interacting with astrocyte-defined synaptic clusters (ADSCs), and that astrocytic mitochondria are positioned closer to larger ADSCs. This finding points to a new, unexpected level of complexity in brain organization. Our study also makes available a series of computational tools new to cell biology, which are well suited for studying astrocytes and other cell types of any level of complexity.\n\n## RESULTS\n\n## Resolving and quantifying astrocytic nanoarchitecture\n\nThere are two main impediments to quantifying astrocytic nanoarchitecture. First, astrocytes have an irregular anatomy composed of nanoscopic processes that confocal and superresolution light microscopy cannot fully resolve, even when using membrane-targeted labels (Figures 1A and 1B). ${ }^{4,16}$ Second, there is a dearth of methods capable of interrogating astrocytic structural complexity. Important observations have been made using qualitative approaches and indirect measurements of astrocytic structure. ${ }^{3,17-20}$ However, a systematic analysis of the 3D astrocytic structure requires specialized computational approaches for accurate structural measurements.\n\nTo address these impediments, we developed a pipeline for systematic, quantitative analyses of astrocytic nanoarchitecture (Figures 1C-1E). We used focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy (FIB-SEM) to produce uninterrupted series of layer $2 / 3$ mouse somatosensory (S1) cortex (mill depth $=8 \\mathrm{~nm}$, axial resolution $=4.13 \\mathrm{~nm}$; Figures 1C and 1D). Fine astrocytic processes were clearly resolved while providing a sufficiently wide field of view to image large subvolumes containing neuropil and perivascular subcompartments (Figure 1F). Large volumes of astrocytes were manually segmented yielding three astrocytic reconstructions from three mice, with perivascular EF, mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and postsynaptic densities (PSDs) also segmented (Figures 1H, 1I, and S1;Videos S1, S2, and S3).\n\n## Fundamental building blocks and architectural\n\n## signatures of layer 2/3 astrocytes\n\nReconstructed astrocytic processes had distinct thick and thin regions and did not simply taper progressively toward their tips. We therefore developed an approach for describing astrocytic nanostructure, where, moving inward from the fine tips of processes, we decomposed the astrocyte into constituent \"parts.\" We defined measures of protrusiveness and thickness for every vertex in a 3D mesh describing an astrocytic surface (Figures 2A, 2B, and S1A-S1E). Using these measures, we identified thin, local surface protrusions that corresponded to tips. We then simulated surface flows, using a fast-marching method, ${ }^{21}$ beginning at tips and ending at thick, core regions. Moving progressively along the length of processes, we located boundaries between parts at regions of abrupt change in thickness. From this we classified fundamental part types composing the astrocyte: thin \"constrictions\" present at process tips and within the branching structure, thicker \"expansions,\" and the thickest trunk- or pillar-like \"core\" regions (Figures 2C and 2D). This unveiled a small number of core regions representing large processes (maximum thickness\n\n836 nm ) giving rise to a complex array of thinner processes (Figures 2C, S1F, and S1G). A repeating motif of expansions separated by constrictions became apparent (Figure 2E). The proportions of surface-mapped geometric measurements (Figures 2F and S1E) and part types (Figures 2F and S1H) were consistent across astrocytes, as were surface areas, volumes, and surface area-to-volume ratios (S/V) of constrictions and expansions (Figures 2G and S1I). This was also true for thickness-protrusiveness measurements (Figure 2H). Astrocyte 3 showed slight but significant differences in thickness (Figure 2H) that may be related to it being a larger, more complete sample, fully embedded in neuropil, as opposed to being near other structures such as a blood vessel, like astrocyte 2 (Figures S1B and S1C). We also compared the distribution of local widths of astrocyte 3 to that of the apical dendrite, and associated obliques, of a layer 5 somatosensory mouse neuron. ${ }^{22}$ This portion of a dendritic arbor, although it contains many thin regions such as spine necks and heads, is skewed significantly thicker than the portion of the astrocyte we examined, reflecting the thin, space-filling nature of astrocytic processes (Figure 2I). The maximal thicknesses were 0.8 and $2.02 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$ for astrocyte 3 and the dendrite, respectively. Meshed and voxelized astrocytic models showed consistent fundamental parts (Figure S1J). Together, these results suggest that layer $2 / 3$ astrocytes have a quantifiable, consistent nanostructural composition.\n\nHow does SEM sectioning interval impact detection of fine astrocytic structures? In astrocytes 1, 2, and 3, respectively, 18\\%, $22 \\%$, and $32 \\%$ of vertices were on regions with a thickness $<50 \\mathrm{~nm}$, while $45 \\%, 45 \\%$, and $57 \\%$ were on regions with a thickness $<70 \\mathrm{~nm}$. Only $0.04 \\%, 2.3 \\%$, and $2.5 \\%$ of surface points were on regions with a thickness $<29 \\mathrm{~nm}$, respectively. To simulate how larger sectioning intervals affect astrocytic reconstructions, we omitted layers used to generate them. Processes were lost at intervals above 8 nm , and this was exacerbated at larger intervals (Figures 2J and S2A). While the overall volume of the remaining structures was not drastically altered with increasing interval size (Figure 2K), the number of separated components rose steeply, especially at intervals $>30 \\mathrm{~nm}$ (Figure 2L). This fragmentation was a consequence of splitting of the astrocytic volume at locally thin regions. We also considered viewpoint invariant radii of astrocytic processes to estimate parts that could be potentially lost when sectioning in any plane (Figures S2B and S2C). Large numbers of parts stand to be lost, particularly at intervals $>30 \\mathrm{~nm}$, impacting structural interpretation and connectivity analysis of astrocytes. Thus, thin serial sectioning intervals are essential for accurate representation of astrocytic nanostructure.\n\nTo quantitatively describe the organization of astrocytic structure (i.e., whether they are sponge-like or have strictly hierarchical branching), we interpreted cores, expansions, and constrictions as nodes in a directed graph. Starting at core regions, edges were directed outward toward connecting parts in a recursive manner until a terminal part was reached. The resulting graphs revealed shallow but wide networks of astrocytic parts: astrocyte 3, the most complete section of astrocyte, was composed of 13 hierarchical levels, while individual levels contained up to 331 distinct parts (Figures 3A, 3B, and S3A-S3D). Connectivity hubs giving rise to many other parts were apparent. Examining the numbers of edges extending from each node (outdegree) confirmed this (Figures 3C-3H). While the large majority"

Hubs were formed exclusively by cores and expansions (Figure 3F) and were larger than lower connectivity parts (hubs $7.5 \\times 10^{6} \\mu \\mathrm{~m}^{3}$, nodes $1.9 \\times$ $10^{7} \\mu \\mathrm{~m}^{3}, \\mathrm{p}=0.0014$; Figures 3C and 3G). The latter was also true when only expansions were considered (expansion hubs $0.23 \\pm$ $0.031 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}^{3}$, expansion nodes $0.046 \\pm 0.0038 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}^{3}, \\mathrm{p}=5.4 \\times$ $10^{-11}$; Figure 3H). Thus, layer 2/3 astrocytes are organized hierarchically in a wide but shallow network with major connectivity hubs.\n\nAstrocytes are described as being sponge-like with a perforated architecture containing abundant holes and loops, ${ }^{23-27}$ which may facilitate $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ spread. ${ }^{28}$ Evidence for these structures is based on impressions from light microscopy or lowerresolution EM visualizations and is not founded on quantification of 3D astrocytic shape. Addressing this, we generated 3D centerline curve skeletons from astrocytic models to detect holes and loops. Of $>1,000$ putative holes across three datasets, most were due to minute tracing inaccuracies, such as missing voxels, that did not otherwise affect astrocytic shape analysis. We visually inspected 512 putative holes that could not be easily filtered out as missing voxels based on size. We encountered a small number of apparent holes in the models ( $\\sim 500 \\mathrm{~nm}$ diameter) in the vicinity of dendritic spines. However, these were almost always associated with extremely thin regions of the astrocyte in which membranes were pinched together and excluded cytoplasm (Figures S3E-S3G). Due to our segmentation conventions, regions lacking visible cytoplasm were not traced. Importantly, these ambiguous holes did not have other structures passing through them. Of the 512 putative holes, only 3 were bona fide holes (Figure 3I). By contrast, astrocytic processes that wrap around microanatomy without forming truly connected loops were more frequently observed (Figure 3J). We also encountered juxtaposed membranes/processes from the same astrocyte that were not fused (Figure 3K). Overall, our data show that astrocytes consist of independent processes of undulating thickness, emanating from a small number of core regions and hubs, and ending at terminal parts without forming extensive holes or looping structures. This is uncharacteristic of sponge morphology. ${ }^{29}$\n\n## The structure of PAPs\n\nPAPs, also referred to as the glial component of the tripartite synapse, have been characterized in numerous studies. ${ }^{10,30-33}$ However, little is known about what, if any, unique astrocytic\nstructures form PAPs. Qualitative examination of astrocytic compartments in contact with synapses ( $n=416$ ) in segmented datasets did not reveal conspicuous features such as vesicles or particular arrangements of organelles. Our continuous segments of astrocytes allowed assessment of PAP geometry in relation to the surrounding astrocytic structure. We segmented all PSDs in contact with the astrocytic surface ( $n=3$ astrocytic volumes), yielding 2,107 PSDs with expected characteristics (Figures S4AS4D). Using a fast-marching method, ${ }^{21}$ we evolved 3D wavefronts from every PSD to the astrocytic surface to find the geodesic (i.e., shortest path) between the two structures (Figure 4A; Videos S1, S2, and S3). Each geodesic, and hence each PSD, was associated with a contact point on the neighboring PAP (Figure 4B). The majority of contact points occurred at the synaptic cleft (cleft $=94 \\%$, spine $=4 \\%$, axonal bouton $=$ $1 \\%, n=416$; spine and axon contact points were $96.3 \\pm 10 \\mathrm{~nm}$ from cleft through extracellular space). Distances between synapses and PAPs (Figure S4E) were similar in scale to previous reports. ${ }^{34,35}$ We then cross-referenced PSD-PAP contact points against measures of astrocytic nanostructure. The classical view of PAPs places them at tips of astrocytic processes. ${ }^{23,25,36,37}$ To test this assumption, we determined the proportion of astrocytic parts that could be classified as terminal (tips), embedded (flanked on either side), or core (Figure 4C). We used node degree to separate terminal parts (indegree $=1$; outdegree $=0$ ) from embedded parts (outdegree $\\geq 1$ ). The majority of parts were terminal parts, as opposed to embedded parts flanked on either end by other parts ( terminal, $61.5 \\% \\pm 1.9 \\%$; embedded, $38.5 \\% \\pm 1.9 \\% ; \\mathrm{p}=0.0009$; Figure 4D). Constrictions were mainly at terminals but still accounted for an appreciable number of embedded parts (terminal constrictions, $79.1 \\% \\pm$ $2 \\%$; embedded constrictions, $20.9 \\% \\pm 2 \\% ; \\mathrm{p}<0.001$ ), whereas expansions were almost exclusively embedded (terminal, $3.5 \\% \\pm 0.1 \\%$; embedded, $96.5 \\% \\pm 0.1 \\% ; \\mathrm{p}<0.001$; Figure 4E). As synapses are evenly distributed within cortical layers, ${ }^{38}$ we asked if PSD contact points would distribute evenly on the astrocytic surface. The majority of contact points were on embedded parts (terminal, $34 \\% \\pm 3 \\%$; embedded, $57 \\% \\pm 1 \\%$; core, $8 \\% \\pm$ $3 \\% ; \\mathrm{p}<0.001$; Figure 4F). This is likely due to the fact that embedded parts account for almost all expansions, which occupy more surface area and volume (Figures 2F and 2G). To account for this volume factor and investigate whether PSD contact points were distributed randomly on the astrocytic surface, we compared contact points with sets of randomly placed points on the surface ( 33 sets of points per astrocyte, each set equal in number to PSD contact points for that astrocyte).

      "markdown": "sampling was area-weighted to account for variation in vertex density. This revealed an overrepresentation of contact points on constrictions and an underrepresentation on expansions and cores, compared with randomly placed points on the astrocytic surface (constrictions: $53 \\% \\pm 2.4 \\%$ PSD contact points, $39 \\% \\pm 0.2 \\%$ random surface points; expansions: $38.6 \\% \\pm$ $0.9 \\%$ PSD, $46 \\% \\pm 0.02 \\%$ random; cores: $8 \\% \\pm 3.2 \\%$ PSD, $15 \\% \\pm 0.1 \\%$ random; $\\mathrm{p}<0.0001$; Figure 4G). This overrepresentation on constrictions was driven by embedded constrictions (Figures 4H and 4I). Accordingly, PSD contact points fell on vertices with higher protrusiveness and lower thickness (Figures 4J, S4F, and S4G). However, contact points were found across the entire distributions of thickness/protrusiveness scores (Figure 4J), reflecting the presence of contact points, and thus PAPs, on all part types and locations (Figures 4F and 4G). Thus, although PAPs are often terminal constrictions, this is not a rule; they are also embedded deeper within the hierarchy of the astrocytic structure, with both constrictions and expansions forming en-passant PAPs. We also asked whether certain synapse categories were more likely to be contacted by constrictions or expansions (Figure S4H). This was not the case, although expansions contacted a population of synapses with larger PSDs (constriction PSDs $1.77 \\pm 0.06 \\times 10^{6} \\mathrm{~nm}^{3}$, expansion PSDs $2.01 \\pm 0.08 \\times 10^{6} \\mathrm{~nm}^{3}$, core PSDs $1.79 \\pm$ $0.14 \\times 10^{6} \\mathrm{~nm}^{3}, \\mathrm{p}=0.05$; Figure S4I). Thus, while constrictions account for the majority of PAPs, expansions preferentially form PAPs with larger, and likely stronger, more active synapses. The increased volume of expansions may increase capacity for neurotransmitter/ion homeostasis at these larger synapses.\n\n## Astrocytic mitochondria, ER, and MERCs differ between EF and nEF regions\n\nAstrocytic mitochondria are important for $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ signaling and energy production. ${ }^{39,40}$ Investigating mitochondrial ultrastructure in astrocytes, we divided astrocytic models into perivascular EF and \"non-endfoot\" (nEF) regions that interface with the neuropil (Figures S1C and S1D). Here, we added a fourth reference volume containing a capillary with EF. While nEF mitochondria were largely composed of short and long tubules, EF mitochondria were flattened (Figure 5A). EF mitochondria had lower surface $\\mathrm{S} / \\mathrm{V}(\\mathrm{EF}=14.5 \\pm 0.7, \\mathrm{nEF}=18.6 \\pm 1.2, \\mathrm{p}=0.0076$; Figure 5B), lower surface curvatures ( $\\mathrm{EF}=0.014 \\pm 0.001, \\mathrm{nEF}=0.018 \\pm$ $0.001, \\mathrm{p}=0.0018$; Figure 5C), and were thicker ( $\\mathrm{EF}=190.5 \\pm$ $12.6 \\mathrm{~nm}, \\mathrm{nEF}=148.9 \\pm 11.6 \\mathrm{~nm}, \\mathrm{p}=0.022$; Figure 5D) than nEF mitochondria. EF mitochondria were thinned toward their centre, with a concave surface (Figures 5E-5G). Thus, mitochondrial structure in astrocytes relates to mitochondrial location and may reflect functions specific to those locations. For example, increased mitochondrial diameter may minimize production of reactive oxygen species under conditions of excessive nutrient supply, ${ }^{41,42}$ potentially explaining the particular shape of EF mitochondria.\n\nMitochondria work with ER to regulate $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ signaling/homeostasis and lipid biosynthesis. ${ }^{33}$ We therefore reconstructed large\nparts of the ER network (Figure 5H). ER in nEF regions mostly consisted of a polygonal array of tubules (Figure S5A) connected by three-way junctions as described. ${ }^{44}$ By contrast, ER in EF formed large, sheet-like cisterns (Figure 5H). To compare the amounts of ER tubules vs. cisterns, we analyzed surface curvature ${ }^{45}$ and found that EF ER, where sheet-like cisterns predominated, had smaller total curvature (Figures S5A-S5C). ER cisterns in EF were at times arranged in two layers, with one layer facing the capillary in close apposition to the adluminal astrocytic membrane. Mitochondria were nestled between two ER sheets, forming extensive mitochondria-ER contact sites (MERCs), often along their flattened portions (Figure 5Hii). Occasionally, ER tubules passed through the centre of flat mitochondria, highlighting a tight interaction between these EF organelles (Figures 5Hi and 5Hiii). MERCs are important sites for $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ exchange and lipid and protein biosynthesis, and they are altered in disease. ${ }^{46}$ Investigating the differences between MERCs in EF and nEF regions, we compared the area of mitochondrial outer membrane contributing to MERCs (Figure 5I). ${ }^{47} \\mathrm{EF}$ MERCs were larger than those in nEF regions ( $\\mathrm{EF}=0.14 \\pm$ $0.03 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}^{2}, \\mathrm{nEF}=0.038 \\pm 0.005 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}^{2}, \\mathrm{p}=0.0005$; Figure 5J). MERC coverage of EF mitochondria was nearly double that of nEF mitochondria ( $\\mathrm{EF}=18.3 \\% \\pm 2.5 \\%, \\mathrm{nEF}=9.3 \\% \\pm 1.1 \\%$, $\\mathrm{p}=0.006$; Figure 5K). The more extensive MERCs in EF may relate to heightened metabolic need at the neurovascular interface. ${ }^{48}$ Overall, our results demonstrate specific structural adaptations of astrocytic mitochondria, ER, and MERCs in astrocytic subcompartments.\n\n## Structural properties of excitatory synapses do not influence their proximity to the astrocytic surface or mitochondria\n\nAs mitochondria give rise to a significant portion ( $\\sim 25 \\%-30 \\%$ ) of $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ events in astrocytes, ${ }^{39}$ play a central role in energy metabolism, and display activity-related mobility related to glutamate transporter activity, ${ }^{49}$ we hypothesized that astrocytic mitochondrial position is influenced by nearby synapses (Figure 6A). To test this, we computed geodesics from PSDs to their nearest contact points on the astrocytic surface (Figures 4A and 4B; Videos S1, S2, and S3). We then made distance measurements by evolving a 3D wavefront from mitochondria, outward to the astrocytic surface (Figure 6B; Video S4) to measure geodesics through the convoluted intracellular space of astrocytes. The sum of PSD-Astro and Astro-Mito distances gave PSD-Mito distances (Figures 6A and S6A). PSD-Mito distances had variable, multimodal distributions (Figures S6B and S6C). PSD-Astro distances were small ( $0.36 \\pm 0.31 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$ Astro1; $0.32 \\pm 0.017 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$ Astro2; $0.29 \\pm 0.01 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$ Astro3; Figure S6F), and thus PSD-Mito distances were similar to Mito-Astro distances (Figure S6G). Previous work suggested that mitochondria are excluded from PAPs, with a minimal distance of $\\sim 500 \\mathrm{~nm}$ between PSDs and any astrocytic $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ source. ${ }^{20}$ However, we found that synapses varied widely in their proximity to astrocytic mitochondria, ranging from 162.1 nm to $>23.0 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$ (Figure S6C).

Furthermore, no PSD attributes (asymmetric/symmetric; spine/ shaft; presence/absence of spine apparatus; macular/perforated) were associated with distances to their nearest mitochondrion (Figure S6E). These results suggest that PSDs predicted to be associated with stronger synapses (i.e., larger, perforated PSDs with spine apparatuses ${ }^{59-63}$ ) do not lie closer to astrocytic mitochondria relative to astrocytic space.\n\n## Identification of ADSCs\n\nWe observed that PSDs group around certain astrocytic subregions (Figure 6C) and hypothesized that astrocytes form specialized arrangements with clusters of synapses. Given the lack of established ground truth for such synaptic clusters, and given the high degree of astrocytic complexity, a parameter-free, unsupervised clustering approach was required to isolate these clusters. We employed dominant sets (Dsets) clustering, which has been used for a variety of spatial clustering problems and requires only a similarity matrix as input. ${ }^{53-55}$ Using a fast-marching approach, we calculated PSD-to-PSD pairwise distances to obtain distance matrices for all PSDs in each astrocytic volume (Figures 6D, 6E, and S7A). Applying a customized Dset clustering algorithm to the resulting distance matrices revealed that synapses form discrete ADSCs based on distances from one another, ranging in size from 4 to 55 PSDs per cluster (Figures 6F-6H). Since ADSCs are based on PSD-PSD distance measured through the astrocyte, discrete astrocytic subregions are associated with each cluster (Figure 6G). Cluster size did not correlate with the proportion of different synapse categories represented therein (symmetric proportion vs. cluster size, $r^{2}=$ $-0.003, \\mathrm{p}=0.3$; shaft vs. size, $\\mathrm{r}^{2}=-0.01, \\mathrm{p}=0.7$; spine apparatus vs. size, $r^{2}=-0.03, p=0.09$; perforation vs. size, $r^{2}=$ $-0.01, p=0.6$ ), nor did cluster size correlate with PSD volume within clusters ( $r^{2}=-0.009, p=0.2$ ). To demonstrate that astrocytic morphology played the operant role in defining ADSCs, we clustered PSDs based solely on their distances from one another (Euclidean distance) as a negative control, ignoring the astrocyte. This yielded a distinct set of clusters with different mean pairwise distances between their PSDs when compared with the \"intravolume\" PSD-PSD distances through the astrocytic cytoplasm (intravolume $11.1 \\pm 0.67 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$, Euclidean $5.74 \\pm$ $0.19 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}, \\mathrm{p}=1.9 \\times 10^{-13}$ ). This is expected owing to the convoluted astrocytic morphology. Thus, our data suggest that astrocytes partition the synaptic space, creating ADSCs. This indicates that synapses relate to one another based on how astrocytes interact with them, in addition to where they fall in Euclidean space and within a neural circuit.\n\n## ADSCs predict the location of astrocytic mitochondria\n\nWhile individual synapses and synapse types did not lie closer to astrocytic mitochondria, it is possible that ADSCs have a spatial link to astrocytic mitochondria. Remarkably, cluster size was inversely correlated with the mean distance of mitochondria to\nthe PSDs in that cluster (Figure 7A). This suggests that astrocytic mitochondria are positioned closer to larger ADSCs. The same was true when clustering was performed on distances between PSDs measured along the astrocytic surface, rather than through the cytoplasm (Figure S7B). This effect was present whether or not symmetric PSDs were excluded (Figure S7C). These results were largely replicable with k-means and density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) clustering algorithms, which require parameters to be chosen a priori (Figure S7D). PSD clusters based on the Euclidean PSD-PSD distances (neglecting the astrocyte) did not show a similar correlation (Figure S7B), demonstrating that astrocytic morphology is key to the relationship between ADSCs and astrocytic mitochondria.\n\nTo verify that larger synaptic clusters do not lie closer to astrocytic mitochondria simply by virtue of taking up more space, we repeated the analysis while omitting shorter PSD-Mito distances from each cluster (Figure 7B). When omitting the shortest $50 \\%$ of distances, the shortest $75 \\%$ of distances, or all but the single longest PSD-Mito distances per cluster, the correlation between cluster mean PSD-Mito distance and cluster size remained. This indicates that large clusters as a whole are located more closely to mitochondria, rather than just a subset of their PSDs. Additionally, PSDs close to the edge of the reference volumes may be more appropriately sorted into clusters centered outside the dataset. They may also be closer to mitochondria just outside the dataset. To account for this, we progressively removed PSDs from the edges of the datasets by iteratively shrinking the bounding box of the volumes, excluding PSDs that fell outside the new bounding box. As the population of PSDs considered was eroded, the summary data for the resulting cluster mean PSD-Mito distance vs. cluster size correlation remained significant and relatively stable (Figures 7C and S7E). This indicates consistency in the relationship between ADSCs and PSD-Mito distances and that PSDs on the edge of the volumes do not alter the relationship. As a whole, our results suggest that astrocytes form higher-order interactions with clusters of synapses (rather than with individual synapses), and ADSCs predict the location of astrocytic mitochondria.\n\n## DISCUSSION\n\nAstrocytes are complex cells with seemingly countless thin and convoluted processes. Using FIB-SEM and astrocyte-tailored computer vision methods, we resolved the geometry of astrocytes and their nanoarchitectural framework. Our analyses relied on measurements using fast-marching methods, accurate geodesics, and medial curves to uncover the fundamental building blocks of astrocytes and their assembly into hierarchical networks. These tools also revealed specific structural characteristics of PAPs and EF/nEF organelles. Finally, applying unbiased clustering, we discovered that astrocytes partition the local microenvironment and interact with synaptic clusters, or\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    (H and I) Proportions of contact points vs. random points on (H) terminal or (I) embedded parts.\n    (J) Distributions of protrusiveness (top) and thickness (bottom) values when considering all vertices (yellow) or only PSD contact points (blue), astrocyte 3, Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, ${ }^{* * *} \\mathrm{p}<0.0001$.

These results provide insight into how astrocytes are constructed, form hierarchical networks with minimal looping structures, have distinct mitochondria/MERC architecture at EF, and how they possess a consistent architecture across datasets with constrictions and expansions that infiltrate the CNS and contact synapses. This specific structure of astrocytes has implications for how they pervade the local microenvironment and how they control the distribution of organelles, receptors, and signaling molecules that impact processes including $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ diffusion and synaptic function.\n\nAside from PAPs and EF, astrocytes do not display obvious structures akin to those found on neurons, such as axonal/dendritic branches, synapses, presynaptic boutons, and spines. Using shape analysis, we decomposed astrocytes into fundamental building blocks (constrictions, expansions, and cores). Astrocytes have been qualitatively described as consisting of branches, branchlets, and leaflets. However, this does not capture the alternating pattern of constrictions and expansions we observed, and it underestimates the depth of astrocytic hierarchical structure (Figures 3A, 3D, and S3). As process diameter can dictate the spread of $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ signals in astrocytes, with thinner diameter favoring decreased flux, increased propagation, and lower propagation failure rates, ${ }^{29}$ the alternating constriction-expansion arrangement may spatially constrain local $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ signals and be partly responsible for astrocytic microdomain $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ events.\n\nThe astrocytes we examined rarely contained holes or loops. Extensive, small astrocytic loops or \"rings\" have been reported near synapses, using super-resolution light microscopy. ${ }^{23,56}$ However, our automated, medial curve-based approach to locate loops in our datasets uncovered only three true loops. We did encounter cases where thinning of astrocytic processes could not be definitively discerned from small perforations. This thinning, in addition to processes that wrap other structures without forming loops, may account for the apparent rings observed at lower resolutions. These findings challenge the widely held view that astrocytes are spongiform, sponge-like, or have a reticular anatomy. Recent work examining astrocytic reflexive processes concludes that because some astrocytic processes loop back and contact themselves without fusing, the structure is indeed sponge-like, if not precisely spongiform or reticular. ${ }^{30}$ However, the lack of cytoplasm continuity in reflexive processes likely has functional implications for $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ signaling in astrocytic processes: few to no looping connections would limit $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ spread, perhaps biasing $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ dynamics toward localized events. We suggest dispensing with the imprecise sponge analogy and instead using established mathematical terminology for describing mazes. Purely hierarchically branching structures with no loops are referred to as \"simply connected\" or \"perfect\" mazes. Neurons are examples of perfect mazes. Astrocytes are thus nearly perfect mazes with very sporadic, local holes. Indeed, following the tortuous network of astrocytic processes evokes the sense of being lost in a maze.\n\nAstrocytic $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ events relate to neural activity ${ }^{57,58}$ and are needed for synaptic transmission/plasticity. ${ }^{59,60}$ Astrocytic mitochondria are one source of such $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ events. ${ }^{39}$ Given that astrocytic mitochondria can be repositioned, but are largely static in vivo, ${ }^{61}$ we asked whether astrocytic mitochondria preferentially localize near synapses. Although single synapses did not influence mitochondrial position, we found that synapses cluster around discrete astrocytic subregions creating ADSCs, and that ADSCs relate to mitochondrial placement in astrocytes. Thus, ADSCs constitute a CNS structural unit with potential relevance to neural circuit function. While functional synaptic clusters localized to individual dendrites have been observed, ${ }^{62,63}$ neither functional nor structural ADSCs have been reported. Theoretical frameworks have proposed that astrocytes form functional \"synaptic islands,\" whereby an astrocyte regulates thousands of synapses as a group. ${ }^{36,64}$ However, recent work suggests that $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ microdomains localized to astrocytic processes may respond to and regulate local clusters of synapses to enhance hippocampal place coding. ${ }^{65}$ Furthermore, depolarization of an astrocytic process following nearby synaptic activity can modulate glutamate uptake. ${ }^{66}$ This points to reciprocal regulation between astrocytic processes and groups of synapses clustered around them. ADSCs provide an enticing structural correlate to these functional synaptic clusters surrounding astrocytic processes that have emerged, but which, up to this point, had not been resolved anatomically. Local regulation of ADSCs may allow astrocytes to tune functional units of synapses with respect to local contexts such as clustered synaptic inputs from particular neurons, neuronal types, or brain regions.\n\nThe distance between mitochondria and synapses in an ADSC decreased with increasing ADSC size. This spatial relationship suggests yet a further level of complexity in CNS organization. While studies in neurons show that mitochondria are recruited to areas of heightened activity, the structural complexity of astrocytes complicates similar experimentation in astrocytes. ${ }^{67}$ In vitro evidence, using bath application of pharmacological agents, suggests mitochondrial mobility/positioning is coupled to glutamate uptake and $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ influx. ${ }^{49,67}$ However, local interventions, for instance, focal application of glutamate or glutamate transporter blockers, or local silencing/ablation of synapses, are needed to elucidate signals that regulate astrocytic mitochondrial positioning. Furthermore, as mitochondria, ER, and MERCs differ between EF and the nEF regions where astrocytes interact with ADSCs, local signals that define the shape/function of organelles in different subcompartments need exploration. Astrocytes also regulate synapse and circuit formation, ${ }^{68}$ and mitochondria become less motile as development progresses. ${ }^{61}$ This raises interesting developmental/mechanistic questions. Do developing synaptic clusters instruct astrocytic ramification, or do astrocytes determine which synapses form/persist in a cluster? Do synaptic clusters recruit mitochondria, or does mitochondrial placement promote synaptic cluster formation/consolidation? Do these processes rely on neuronal activity and sensory\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    (J and K) Comparison of (J) MERC size and (K) fraction of mitochondrial surface occupied by MERCs, in endfeet and non-endfoot regions.

Mice were housed on a 12:12 inverted light:dark cycle and cared for according to standard operating procedures at McGill University and the Research Institute of the McGill University Health Centre.\n\n## METHOD DETAILS\n\n## In Utero Electroporation\n\nIn utero electroporation (IUE) was performed largely as previously described. ${ }^{84}$ Timed-pregnant female CD1 mice were purchased from Charles River Laboratories (Saint Constant, QC). Surgeries were performed on embryonic day 18. Pregnant mice were anesthetized using isoflurane and kept on a homothermic warming pad. An incision along the abdomen was made to expose the uterine horns containing embryos. After exposing the uterine horns, embryos were periodically flushed with warm ( $37^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ ) sterile PBS (Gibco, Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA). Using pulled borosilicate pipettes that were bevelled with diamond lapping film (FOSCO, Fremont, CA), $3 \\mu \\mathrm{l}$ of DNA mixture was injected into the lateral ventricles. Precise injection volume was attained with a foot pedal-controlled Elite Nanomite syringe pump (Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA). The DNA mixture contained $1 \\mu \\mathrm{~g} / \\mu \\mathrm{l}$ PB-GfaABC ${ }_{1} D$-Lck-mCherry to label astrocytic plasma membranes, $1 \\mu \\mathrm{~g} / \\mu \\mathrm{l}$ PB-GfaABC1D-mitoDendra2 to label astrocytic mitochondria, and $1 \\mu \\mathrm{~g} / \\mu \\mathrm{l}$ transposaseexpressing PB200PA-1 (Clontech, Takara Bio, USA; SBI Systems Bioscience, Palo Alto, CA). To help visualize the injection of the DNA mixture, $0.1 \\%(\\mathrm{w} / \\mathrm{v})$ of Fast Green dye (Millipore Sigma, Oakville, Ontario) was added to the solution and adjusted to the final volume with sterile PBS. Following injection of the DNA, 3 mm tweezer-electrodes were used to apply $3 \\times 50 \\mathrm{~ms} 42 \\mathrm{~V}$ pulses at 950 ms intervals via an ECM 830 square pulse generator (BTX, Holliston, MA). After injection of all the embryos, the uterine horns were placed back inside the abdomen and the incision site sutured. Pregnant mice were returned to their home cage and given post-surgical analgesics for 3 days and monitored until full recovery.\n\n## DNA Constructs\n\nAstrocytes and their precursors divide rapidly throughout postnatal development which makes episomal plasmid delivery less favorable due to the dilution of the DNA and low efficiency of gene expression following IUE. With the PiggyBac transposon system, DNA constructs are integrated into chromosomal DNA, thus resulting in stable gene expression. PiggyBac plasmids were purchased from SBI Systems Bioscience (Palo Alto, CA). All DNA constructs used for astrocyte targeted expression were manually cloned into the transposon plasmid (PB513B-1) under control of the modified human GFAP promoter, GfaABC ${ }_{1} D$ using restriction cloning and InFusion HD assembly (Clontech, Takara Bio, USA). The following sequence elements were obtained from Addgene: GfaABC ${ }_{1} D$ (\\#19974), Lck (\\#34924), and mitoDendra2 (\\#55796). The mCherry sequence was originally obtained from a plasmid donated by Dr. Roger Tsien (UCSD). DNA was prepared using the endotoxin-free NucleoBond Xtra Maxi EF kit (Clontech, Takara Bio, USA).\n\n## Perfusion and tissue preparation for light microscopy\n\nElectroporated mice ( 6 months old; male and female; CD1) were anesthetized with isoflurane and tissue fixed by transcardial perfusion first with ice cold DPBSfollowed by $4 \\%$ paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer ( pH 7.4 ) at $5 \\mathrm{ml} / \\mathrm{min}$ for 5 minutes. Brains were removed and post-fixed in the same solution overnight at $4^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$. Following equilibration in $30 \\%$ sucrose in DPBS, the tissue was embedded in OCT (Somagen, Edmonton, AB) and snap frozen. Brains were cryosectioned coronally at $30 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$ thickness and stored in DPBSat $4^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ until use. Sections were mounted onto charged Superfrost√† Plus glass slides and preserved with SlowFade Gold Antifade Mountant (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA). Confocal microscopy was performed using an Olympus FV1000 laser scanning confocal microscope with a 60x oil-immersion objective (N.A. 1.4) at a resolution of $0.132 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}^{2} /$ pixel. Stuctured Illumination Microscopy (SIM) image stacks were acquired using a Zeiss LSM880 ElyraPS1 microscope with a 63x oil-immersion objective (PlanApochromat 63x/1.40 Oil DIC). All images were obtained using 5 rotations and processed for SIM using the Zeiss Zen software.\n\n## Electron microscopy sample preparation\n\nPostnatal day 50 adult male C57/Bl6 mice were anaesthetized with ketamine-xylazine cocktail and transcardially perfused with 910 ml of 0.1 M phosphate buffer (PB) at room temperature (RT) at $7 \\mathrm{~mL} / \\mathrm{min}$, followed by $210-280 \\mathrm{~mL}$ perfusion with $2.5 \\%$ glutaraldehyde, $2 \\%$ formaldehyde, 0.1 M PB at $7 \\mathrm{~mL} / \\mathrm{min}$. Brains were post-fixed in the same fixative solution at $4^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ for 6-12 hours.

Ultrathin sections were examined by transmission electron microscopy on a Tecnai 12 BioTwin 120kV TEM equipped with an AMT XR80C CCD Camera (FEI, Hillsboro, OR) to assess tissue and staining quality.\n\n# FIB-SEM \n\nFIB-SEM imaging was performed as described previously. ${ }^{85}$ Briefly, Epon blocks containing tissue from four mice were trimmed with a razor blade to expose the region of interest, and were then mounted on a $45^{\\circ}$ pre-titled SEM stub and coated with a 4 mm layer of platinum to enhance electrical conductivity. Gallium ion beam milling of serial sections and block face imaging after each mill were carried out on a Helios Nanolab 660 DualBeam system using Auto Slice \\& View G3 ver 1.5.3 software (FEI, Hillsboro, OR). The sample block was first imaged to determine the orientation of the block face and ion and electron beams. A protective platinum layer $80 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$ long, $19 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$ wide and $2 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$ thick was deposited on the surface orthogonal to the block, where the ion beam is first incident, to protect the sample from ion beam damage and to correct for stage and/or specimen drift. Trenches were milled on both sides of the region of interest to minimize re-deposition of milled material during automated milling and imaging. Fiducial markers were generated for both ion and electron beam imaging and were used to dynamically correct for drift in the $x$ - and $y$-directions during data collection by applying appropriate scanning EM beam shifts. Milling was carried out at 30 kV with an ion beam current of 9.3 nA , stage tilt of $6.5^{\\circ}$, and working distance of 4 mm . At each step, 8 nm of the block face was removed by the ion beam. This mill depth was chosen to ensure resolution of the smallest astrocytic processes while still collecting images of an appreciable volume. Each newly milled block face was imaged simultaneously with the Through the Lens Detector (TLD) for backscattered electrons and In-Column Detector (ICD) at an accelerating voltage of 2 kV , beam current of 0.4 nA , stage tilt of $44.5^{\\circ}$, and working distance of 3 mm . The pixel resolution was 4.13 nm with a dwell time of $30 \\mu \\mathrm{~s}$ per pixel. Pixel dimensions of the recorded image were $3072 \\times 2048$ pixels. The acquired image stacks from different mice measured $12.7 \\times 8.5 \\times 4.4 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$ for Volume 1 ( 551 images), $12.7 \\times 8.5 \\times 5.4 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$ for Volume 2 ( 672 images) and $12.7 \\times 8.5 \\times 7.8 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$ ( 976 images). A fourth dataset ( 635 images) was collected to add additional endfeet from another mouse to the analysis.\n\n## 3D Reconstructions\n\nTrakEM2 was used for stack alignment and segmentation. ${ }^{86}$ Astrocytes were identified by clear cytoplasm devoid of visibly oriented microtubules, the presence of dark staining glycogen granules, and the absence of synaptic inputs (personal communication with Dr. Spacek). ${ }^{9}$ Astrocytic mitochondria also stained more lightly than neuronal mitochondria. Due to the extremely fine, convoluted processes of astrocytes, extensive quality control (QC) was required. Reconstructions correspond to $1 / 30^{\\text {In }}, 1 / 75^{\\text {In }}$ and $1 / 200^{\\text {In }}$ of a single astrocyte (Astro $3734.55 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}^{3}$, Astrocyte $2314.39 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}^{3}$, Astrocyte $1127.09 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}^{3}$ ) based on a whole astrocyte volume of $30,500 \\mathrm{~nm}^{3}$ and $30 \\%$ shrinkage of SS cortex after glutaraldehyde fixation. ${ }^{87}$ Two to four rounds of QC were performed (see supplemental information). Occasionally processes were so thin that cytoplasm could not be distinguished due to reduced resolution of the scanning EM approach. Tracing was stopped at these junctures. 3D models were generated using Blender and MATLAB.\n\n## Astrocyte segmentation quality control\n\nTo perform QC, we overlaid a grid onto the TrakEM2 workspace and panned through the entire volume within each square of the grid, flagging errors and omissions for later confirmation and segmentation. Generally, new PSDs and new astrocytic branches (sometimes quite large), were discovered during QC. Segmentation of thin astrocytic processes was stopped when astrocytic membranes could not be differentiated from one another. In a number of such cases, it did appear that the astrocytic membrane was simply pinched, rendering the process too thin to be resolved, thus a small number of processes may extend further than the segmented volume shows.\n\n## Astrocytic parts decomposition\n\nWater-tight meshes were initially generated from binary segmentation masks using the isosurface function in MATLAB. Voxel sizes were resampled from $[4.13,4.13,8] \\mathrm{nm}$ to $[4,4,4] \\mathrm{nm}$. The meshes were then decimated to $1 \\%$ of the original face count using gptoolbox (decimate_libigl function; https://github.com/alecjacobson/gptoolbox). A local thickness value T was then assigned to each mesh vertex by association with the radius of the maximally inscribed sphere within the object, or equivalently, the distance to the closest medial surface point. ${ }^{55} \\mathrm{~A}$ \"bump\" score B was assigned by measuring the Euclidean distance between a vertex and the weighted average of the coordinates of the other vertices in its 15 -hop neighborhood. To avoid errors due to small local perturbations in the mesh arising from segmentation and alignment artifacts, the mesh vertex locationswere smoothed (Gaussian, $\\sigma=3$; 10x) prior to bump score calculation.\n\nThe local thickness and bump score values were then combined in a protrusion measure $P$, to identify the tips of astrocytic processes. We first normalized these scores to lie between 0 and 1, resulting in scaled thickness and bump scores, Ts and Bs. The"

      "markdown": "protrusion score was then defined as $\\mathrm{P}=\\mathrm{Bs} *(1-\\mathrm{Ts})$. This allowed the score to reach maximal values at the tips of thin astrocytic processes. Vertices with $\\mathrm{P}>0.5$ were considered to be process- or branch-tips.\n\nBeginning from each branch-tip, we simulated a region-growing surface flow that ultimately allowed us to assign part types (core, expansion, constriction) and boundaries to patches of the mesh. The surface flow procedure was designed to halt at core regions. Approximate \"seed core regions\" were first assigned as regions with $\\mathrm{P}<0.15$ ( P -scores smoothed with $20 x$ Gaussian blur, $\\sigma=3$ ) and Ts>0.9 (Ts smoothed with 10x Gaussian blur, $\\sigma=3$ ). This identified thick regions with relatively flat boundaries. A front was then evolved independently from each branch tip, by including the previously unvisited 1-hop neighbours of the vertices in the present front, at each iteration. The growing front was also required to contain an element of the shortest path from the branch-tip to the nearest core to prevent side arms from being followed. This process was repeated until a core was reached. Arrays containing summary Ts values for the set of vertices for each iteration of front evolution were stored. Empirical derivatives of curves describing changes in local thickness along the path of the evolving front were then used to find inflection points in the rate of change of the thickness. Inflection points and the magnitudes of the $3^{\\text {rd }}$ derivatives were used to define boundaries between adjacent thicker and thinner parts (expansions and constrictions, respectively). Each surface flow process created a model that assigned vertices in a subregion of the mesh as either \"expansion\", \"constriction\" or \"unassignable\" such that models overlapped. Thus, a consensus model was generated with vertex assignment prioritizing expansion identity, followed by constriction identity, followed by unassignable identity. In other words, vertices labelled expansion in any surface flow were labelled as expansion vertices in the final model. Vertices labelled constriction in at least one surface flow, but never labelled expansion, were labelled constriction in the final model. Vertices only labelled unassignable were left unassigned. Finally, seed core regions were grown outward to all connected vertices with Ts<0.9, to label the final core regions.\n\n## Loop detection\n\nWe generated medial curve skeletons for voxelized astrocytic volumes using topology invariant thinning. ${ }^{88,89}$ The curve skeletons were then converted to a graph with vertices at each skeleton voxel and edges between adjacent voxels in the 26 neighbourhood. We edited the graph by removing intermediate vertices along linear chain regions. This reduced the size of the graph without changing the topology, making the algorithms much faster and feasible to run on our large volumes. We then computed the spanning tree of the skeleton graph using Kruskal's algorithm. All the edges not contained in the spanning tree were identified as part of a putative loop. The corresponding loops for each edge were computed using a simple depth-first search on the graph constructed from the spanning tree with the edge included. In the graphical representation, the astrocyte is represented as a directed acyclic graph (DAG). Loops in DAGs were identified by inspecting the indegree of nodes. Nodes with indegree greater than 1 were marked as parts of a multi-part loop. The entire loop was then reconstructed by backtracking to the lowest common ancestor, keeping track of each edge on the paths.\n\n## PSDSegmentation and profiling\n\nWe manually segmented all PSDs contacted by segmented astrocytes in reference volumes. PSDs were considered to be associated with the astrocyte if the PAP made contact anywhere on the synaptic unit (defined as the synaptic cleft, spine head, spine neck and axonal bouton). ${ }^{91}$ For shaft synapses, since the variable size of the postsynaptic dendrites meant that the postsynaptic compartment could be very large, only shaft synapses contacted on the axonal varicosity or at the synaptic cleft were considered. Only PSDs that had clear symmetric or asymmetric dark staining and had at least three apparent vesicles were segmented. ${ }^{90}$ Nearly all PSDs were associated with many docked and undocked vesicles. In each reference volume, a small proportion of PSDs were omitted from analyses as they were cut off at the edge of the volume and hence partial or distorted due to FIB-milling artifacts. PSDs were categorized by: 1) their location (spine, dendritic shaft, cell body); 2) their type (asymmetric or symmetric); 3) the presence or absence of a spine apparatus (SA); 4) whether they were macular or perforated; 5) whether they were associated with endoplasmic reticulum (ER) at the PSD, spine base or in the spine neck.\n\n## Geodesic distance measurements\n\nWe used a fast marching method ${ }^{21}$ to solve the eikonal equation both inside and outside the segmented astrocytes to compute distance from mitochondria to PSDs. Mitochondrial surfaces were used as the initial wave-front inside the astrocytic volume, and the astrocytic surface was used as the initial wave-front outside the astrocytic volume. The fast marching approach allowed us to evolve the initial surfaces to compute distance from mitochondria at every point inside the astrocyte volume (Video S4) and from the astrocyte surface to every point outside the astrocyte (Videos S1, S2, and S3). We assumed a constant isotropic metric everywhere inside and outside the astrocytic surface. To compute shortest paths, we use gradient descent on the computed distance map.\n\n## Mitochondria, ER and MERC Analysis\n\nMitochondria, sections of ER, and MERCs were reconstructed manually using TrakEM2. MERCs were identified as sections of ER membrane that were separated less than 30 nm from the outer mitochondrial membrane, with an electron dense cleft between the organelles. ${ }^{91}$ The contact points between the ER and outer mitochondrial membrane were used to determine the length of MERCs. Triangulated meshes of reconstructed organelles were exported from TrakEM2 as wavefront.obj files and imported into Blender or MATLAB for analysis. We used the NeuroMorph Blender plugin ${ }^{18}$ to obtain surfaces and volume of manually reconstructed mitochondria. Vertices located on the edges of the image stack were manually excluded prior to analysis to avoid artifacts. To"

      "markdown": "estimate the surface area of manually segmented MERCs, the surfaces of the 3D object, which faced mitochondria, were manually selected and measured using NeuroMorph.\n\nSurface curvatures for reconstructed mitochondria and ER were computed using the MATLAB Graph Theory Toolbox. ${ }^{92}$ Meshes were smoothed to reduce segmentation artifacts by applying a combinatorial Laplacian operator. ER surface points were clustered based on their total curvature ( $\\mid \\mathrm{k} 1\\{+\\mid \\mathrm{k} 2\\}$ ). A 3-component Gaussian mixture model was fit to the ER surface curvature data using the fitgmdist function in MATLAB (1000 iterations, 10 replicates). Surface vertices were labeled based on this model. To account for the very different size of reconstructed ER datasets, we combined random samples of equal size from each dataset as input to the fitting function. ER curvature calculations and clustering were performed on the GRAHAM(GP3) computing cluster at the University of Waterloo, through the Compute Canada (www.computecanada.ca) network.\n\nMitochondrial local thickness was computed from binary images using the local thickness plugin in FIJI. For each mitochondrion we computed the average value of the distance map output obtained from this plugin.\n\n# Dominant sets clustering \n\nMost clustering methods, such as k-means, seek a strict partition of the entities into disjoint sets. We chose instead to use the dominant sets (Dsets) clustering algorithm ${ }^{55,93,94}$ which provides a formal definition of a cluster for each set of PSDs grouped and allows for a clear theoretical interpretation of the results. This method requires as input a measure of pairwise similarity between each pair of entities. These similarities are expressed in terms of the entries in an adjacency matrix. The method then finds clusters with two guarantees. First, entities (PSDs) within the same cluster have a high degree of internal coherence, i.e., there is a high degree of similarity between any pair of PSDs within the same cluster. Second, the clusters are locally maximal, in that no cluster can be absorbed within a larger one, without decreasing the average pairwise similarities.\n\nOur application of the DSets algorithm used a similarity score that is inversely proportional to the geodesic distances between pairs of PSDs either within the astrocyte volume (intra-volume distance) or along the surface of the astrocytes (surface distance). We associated each PSDto the closest point on the astrocyte surface. Geodesic distance was then computed between points on astrocyte surface closest to each PSDusing fast marching. To compute pairwise distance from each PSDsurface point to every other PSDsurface point on the astrocyte, we repeated the process with every PSDas the starting point. We experimented with several monotonically decreasing functions of geodesic distance in constructing the similarity weights of the adjacency matrix, all of which gave essentially the same results.\n\nIn addition to its theoretical guarantee that each cluster is a dominant set, the algorithm provides additional advantages for clustering PSDs. The number of clusters is derived from the data itself - there is no requirement that this be specified a priori. Furthermore, for our case of symmetric affinities, the solutions are maximizers of a quadratic function and can be efficiently found by using an appropriate dynamical system. In practice, both replicator dynamics and infection and immunization dynamics ${ }^{93,94}$ give the same results while the latter is more efficient for large problem sizes.\n\n## QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS\n\nStatistical analyses and data representation were performed using Origin (OriginLab, Northampton MA), Matlab (MathWorks, Natick MA) and R (R Core Team, 2021). R packages used included ggplot2, tidyverse, lemon, scales, igraph, OmnipathR, and dbscan. Unless otherwise noted, mean comparisons were performed using Student's t-test or ANOVA and 2-Way ANOVA with Tukey HSD pairwise comparisons, preceded by the Shapiro-Wilk normality test."
