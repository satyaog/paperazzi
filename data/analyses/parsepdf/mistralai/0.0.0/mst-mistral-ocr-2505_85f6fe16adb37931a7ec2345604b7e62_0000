A flurry of editorials, commentaries, and preliminary trials on ChatGPT have emerged in specialty journals over the past few months. Titles such as \"ChatGPT: Friend or Foe?\" [1] and \"Academic Integrity and Artificial Intelligence: Is ChatGPT Hype, Hero, or Heresy?\" [2], epitomize the medical and academic communities' evolving sentiments-from alarm and enthusiasm to a fragile, cautiously optimistic perspective.\n\nWhile burgeoning literature continues to ask, \"What can ChatGPT do for us?\", little has been written about this revolutionary technology's potential in advancing global surgery equity by democratizing and decolonizing surgical care. We discuss several ways in which this could be achieved in clinical, educational, and research contexts.\n\n## Clinical care\n\n## Augmenting doctors knowledge\n\nGenerative AI chatbots provide valuable information accessible anywhere with internet access, offering a costeffective alternative to aid clinicians in their decision-making processes. ChatGPT can foster clinical decision support systems encompassing knowledge-based support,\n\n[^0]diagnostics, and therapy planning [3]. This capability empowers healthcare providers to develop improved clinical guidelines, receive alerts for adverse drug interactions, and benefit from suggestions for diagnosis and therapy planning. These advancements make surgical knowledge accessible without reliance on costly textbooks and journals or piracy. Indeed, the prevalence of illegal article downloads ( 6 million/month) highlights the limitations of the current publishing system, preventing doctors to improve their quality of care [4]. Making medical knowledge easily and freely accessible is a morally and ethically sound decision, given that it is largely funded by public resources [5].\n\nAlthough current AI models may not be entirely reliable to make clinical decisions without human supervision, our gold-standard human decisions are hardly very reliable: $51 \\%$ of scientific results are inaccurately interpreted by their own authors due to methodological limitations such as subjective assessment tools and inappropriate use of analytical tests [6]. AI has the potential to improve such inaccuracies, and contribute to more evidence-based decisions and guidelines.\n\n## Providing medical information for patients\n\nFor patients in Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs), AI chatbots can offer personalized educational resources in settings where such materials may be scarce or challenging to obtain. The ability to generate on-the-fly content in 18 languages, covering $60 \\%$ of the global population, is particularly beneficial during the postoperative period, when follow-up surgical visits may be logistically and/or economically challenging. While AI chatbots like ChatGPT do not replace standard perioperative surgical education, they offer a more reliable alternative of addressing patient queries than currently used platforms like Google [7].\n\n\n[^0]:    Dan Poenaru\n    dan.poenaru@mcgill.ca\n    1 Departments of Pediatric Surgery and Surgical and Interventional Sciences, McGill University, Montreal, Canada"

      "markdown": "## Surgical education\n\nIn LMICs, access to high-quality educational resources for surgical training can be challenging. Chatbots can generate numerous high-quality multiple-choice and short-answer questions as well as detailed, referenced, model answers, and even clinical examination stations with complete standardized patient instructions and scoring schemes. They can also create a wide array of multi-lingual clinical simulation training scenarios with model responses for each step, based on any given surgical condition or setting [8].\n\n## Surgical research\n\nEquitable access to academic support for research is typically limited in LMICs [9]. Researchers frequently lack a supportive research community, experienced colleagues for guidance, methodological and statistical support, and are often daunted by writing high-quality scientific manuscripts in a foreign language [9]. Chatbots like ChatGPT can assist throughout the research process, from project ideation to manuscript fine-tuning and correction [10].\n\nOne particular area where ChatGPT can be instrumental is in data analysis-by correcting, for instance, code errors in statistical languages like R, and providing guidance on statistical methods [11]. With its multilingual support, code correction, and analytical planning capabilities, ChatGPT becomes a powerful resource for researchers, especially in resource-limited settings. Empowering surgical investigators in LMICs to initiate, conduct, and publish their own studies can effectively disrupt the dominance of HIC authorship and the tokenism still prevalent in global surgical literature [12].\n\n## Warnings and cautions\n\nNotwithstanding the potential benefits, the world of ChatGPT is not without pitfalls. The accuracy of clinical advice, particularly in clinical diagnosis, remains a challenge. More significantly, generative chatbot models may perpetuate the biases embedded in their training data, inadvertently sustaining a legacy of inequity and oppression. Clinicians and data scientists must exercise discernment and intentionality to avoid propagating biased data and foster ethically fair models.\n\n## Final considerations\n\nThe use of AI chatbots such as ChatGPT has the potential to democratize and decolonize surgical care, benefiting patients and surgeons, by addressing equity challenges in\nclinical care, education, and research. It is important, however, to recognize that the true power of chatbots lies in their role as assistants to surgical care providers, rather than replacing them. Human expertise reduces the likelihood of errors in AI algorithms through meticulous review and prompt guidance [3]. It is essential to view AI as a means to amplify human skills rather than replace them, resulting in augmented humans [13]. This collaborative synergy between human expertise and AI assistance can transform chatbots into reliable and efficient partners, optimizing surgeons' valuable time and work.\n\n## References\n\n1.
