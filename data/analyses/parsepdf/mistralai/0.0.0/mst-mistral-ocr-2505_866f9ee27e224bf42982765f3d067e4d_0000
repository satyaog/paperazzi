However, the rarity of cell surface protein targets specific to cancerous but not vital tissue has hindered its broad application to solid tumor treatment. While new logic-gated CAR designs have shown reduced toxicity against healthy tissues, the generalizability of such approaches across tumors remains unclear. Here, we harness a universal characteristic of endogenous T cell receptors (TCRs), their ability to discriminate between self and non-self ligands through inhibition of response against self (weak) antigens, to develop a broadly applicable method of enhancing immunotherapeutic precision. We hypothesized that this discriminatory mechanism, known as antagonism, would apply across receptors, allowing for a transfer of specificityfrom TCRs onto CARs. We therefore systematically mapped out the responses of CAR T cells to joint TCR and CAR stimulations. We transduced ovalbumin-specific TCR T cells with mouse CD19 CAR to produce T cells expressing both TCR and CAR and evaluated the response of TCR/CAR T cells using in vivo and in vitro leukemia models (Figure 1A). We discovered that strong TCR antigen enhanced CAR T killing of CD19 ${ }^{+}$leukemia, while weak TCR antigen antagonized CAR T responses as assessed in vivo cytotoxicity and in vitro multiplexed dynamic profiling (Figure 1B). We developed a mathematical model based on cross-receptor inhibitory coupling that accurately predicted the extent of TCR/CAR antagonism across a wide range of immunological settings. This model was validated in a CD19 ${ }^{+}$B16 mouse melanoma model showing that TCR/CAR antagonism decreased the infiltration of a tumor-reactive T cell cluster (cluster 1), while TCR/CAR agonism enhanced infiltration of this cluster1 (Figure 1C). We then applied our quantitative knowledge of TCR/CAR crosstalk to design an Antagonism-Enforced Braking System (AEBS) for CAR T cell therapy. This was assessed in a model system using a CAR targeting the tyrosine-protein kinase erbB-2 (HER2), expressed on a subset of patients with both B-ALL and AML together with a hedgehog acyltransferase (HHAT) specific TCR, which responds strongly to mutated peptides presented on tumor cells and weakly to wild-type peptides presented on healthy tissue. Consistent with our discovery of the TCR/CAR antagonism, TCR signals against healthy cells expressing wild-type HHAT peptide antigen antagonized HER2 CAR T cell responses, minimizing on-target/off-tumor cytotoxicity against healthy cells. Notably though, AEBS-CAR T cells exhibited high anti-tumor cytotoxicity against tumor cells expressing HER2 and mutated HHAT peptides (Figure 1D). AEBS CAR T cells sharpen the discriminatory power of synthetic anti-tumor lymphocytes, laying the groundwork for future studies to engineer complex logic into cells with minimal numbers of receptors (Figure 1E). Our work highlights a novel mechanism by which TCRs can enforce CAR T cell specificity, with practical implications for the rational design of future anti-leukemia immunotherapies.\n\nDisclosures No relevant conflicts of interest to declare."
