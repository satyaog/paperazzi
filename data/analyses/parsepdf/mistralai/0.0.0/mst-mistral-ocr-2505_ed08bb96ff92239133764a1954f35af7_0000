The availability of images of the Earth's surface from a combination of Landsat and Sentinel-2A and -2B provides an opportunity and capability to track intra-year biomass dynamics availing upon a twice weekly acquisition opportunity. We developed an algorithm that leverages these spatially and spectrally compatible data sources, called Tracking Intra- and Inter-year Change (TIIC), to monitor forest change across Canada's forested ecozones ( $>650 \\mathrm{Mba}$ ) in near-real time. Combining the stand-replacing change information from TIIC with spatially explicit maps of aboveground biomass (AGB), we demonstrate how intra-annual and inter-annual AGB dynamics, including losses due to stand-replacing disturbances and gains from vegetation growth, can be quantified temporally and spatially. Using independent validation data, our results for the focus year 2019 indicate that TIIC, by analysing images from May 30 to September 1, can accurately detect stand-replacing disturbances across Canada's forested ecozones with an overall accuracy of $99 \\%$ and correctly attribute the type of change (i.e., wildfire or mechanical removal, the latter of which includes timber harvesting) with an overall accuracy of $99 \\%$. From an initial producer's accuracy of $23 \\%$ for the changed class, accuracy increases incrementally as additional images are added throughout the growing season. attaining a producer's accuracy of $98 \\%$ by the end of the analysis period. Intrayear change information complements information on long-term trends derived from annual time series monitoring over several decades. Our analysis of AGB dynamics indicated that in every ecozone, widespread small positive AGB increments yielded overall AGB gains that were greater than the sum of the large, punctual AGB losses resulting from stand-replacing disturbances. Overall in 2019, forest AGB increased across Canada's forested ecozones by $2.54 \\%$. Temporally, $80 \\%$ of AGB losses stemming from mechanical removal occurred over the winter and are as such concentrated at the beginning of the growing season. In contrast, AGB losses linked to fires happen more stochastically throughout the growing season and occupy a greater area. By way of disturbance type, $36 \\%$ of 2019 AGB loss was attributed to mechanical removal, and $64 \\%$ was attributed to wildfire. Following the approach demonstrated herein, AGB changes can be tracked at a temporal frequency informative of forest management practices and ecological processes on the landscape, thereby refining our understanding of AGB dynamics.\n\n## 1. Introduction\n\nIn recent decades, spatial and temporal patterns of forest disturbances have been shifting due to the mounting pressure of a changing climate (Zhu et al., 2020). Globally, forest fires (Jones et al., 2022; Kirchmeier-Young et al., 2019) and drought (Hammond et al., 2022) are\nimpacting communities, habitats, and the overall provision of ecosystem services, and habitats. Depending on the severity of a forest disturbance, a frequent outcome is partial or total aboveground biomass (AGB) loss, which is linked to increasing carbon emissions as AGB is an important carbon sink within the global carbon cycle (Houghton, 2005). As the climate continues to warm, disturbances, especially fires, will play an\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    a Corresponding author.\n\n    E-mail address: flavie.pelletier@mail.mcgill.ca (F. Pelletier)."

      "markdown": "increasingly important role on AGB dynamics that will potentially limit forests' ability to serve as carbon sinks (Wang et al., 2021). Therefore, timely detection of forest disturbances is important to inform forest management objectives (White et al., 2019) and minimize the negative consequences linked to AGB loss.\n\nAmidst changing patterns of forest disturbances, satellite remote sensing has been uniquely positioned to offer spatially extensive continuous monitoring of forests at temporal and spatial resolutions that are relevant for management. Whereas remote sensing data were initially used to map forest cover at a point in time (Wulder et al., 2022), the focus has now shifted to multi-date analysis and increasingly continuous change detection (Hansen and Loveland, 2012; Hermosilla et al., 2015a; Woodcock et al., 2020). Key to the development of multiyear forest-change monitoring over large spatial extents was the Landsat mission, which has been providing uninterrupted imaging of the Earth's surface since 1982 at a management-relevant scale (Landsat 4-8: 30 m ). Annual trend-based change detection algorithms use Landsat data to characterize disturbances over long periods and large areas (Hermosilla et al., 2015b; Kennedy et al., 2010). These algorithms rely on systematic observations that have consistent temporal representations to establish trends that enable the detection of both abrupt and gradual change as well as directional trends (White et al., 2014). For example, the Composite-to-Change (C2C) protocol identifies the best available pixel annually, with a mid-summer August 1 target date ( $\\pm 30$ days), to produce annual composites that can be subsequently examined to interpret forest change by disturbance type (Hermosilla et al., 2016; Hermosilla et al., 2015a, Hermosilla et al., 2015b). Landsat based-algorithms have also been developed to track forest changes at a sub-annual scale (Hansen et al., 2016; Ye et al., 2021; Zhu et al., 2020), but Landsat data remain limited for near-real time (NRT) detection when processed independently as related to the revisit time (single-sensor temporal frequency of 16 days; Wulder et al., 2015). The Sentinel-2 satellite constellation has been rapidly adopted as a complement to the Landsat satellites (Claverie et al., 2018). With a higher spatial resolution for the visible and near-infrared bands ( 10 m ) as well as a more frequent revisit rate (single sensor 10 days; Drusch et al., 2012), the combination of two Sentinel-2 satellites providing a 5-day revisit has proven to be a valuable source of data for forest monitoring (Phiri et al., 2020). Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 have geometric and radiometric traits that enable integration (Wulder et al., 2015) and when combined as a three-sensor constellation offer observations of Earth's terrestrial surface every 2.9 days on average (Li and Roy, 2017). The combination of images from both sensors has been critical to decrease temporal revisit intervals, even if the presence of clouds and shadows (and other effects such as haze or smoke) limits the realized yield of usable imagery (Wulder et al., 2015). Ultimately, such multi-sensor dense time series have allowed the development of novel and increasingly NRT algorithms for forest change monitoring.\n\nWith the growing number of Earth observation satellites and the availability of analysis-ready data through cloud computing platforms, large-area mapping of forest change that can provide land managers with information about unfolding forest dynamics is increasingly possible (Woodcock et al., 2020). NRT forest change algorithms include those exclusively based on Landsat imagery like the Continuous monitoring of Land Disturbance (COLD; Zhu et al., 2020), and S-CCD (Ye et al., 2021). Alternatively, other algorithms leverage the power of the dense time series available via harmonized Landsat and Sentinel-2 data (Claverie et al., 2018) such as NRT-MONITOR (Shang et al., 2022) and Breaks For Additive Season and Trends (BFAST), that was originally designed for Landsat data (Verbesselt et al., 2012) but recently integrated HLS datasets (Chen et al., 2021). In the same category, the Shrinking Latency in Multiple Streams (SLIMS) algorithm has been shown to reliably detect stand-replacing forest change within a growing season in Canada (Cardille et al., 2022). Even for NRT algorithms, precise timing of change events can be challenging in cases where data availability is limited (Zhu, 2017). In especially cloudy areas or regions with ongoing wildfire and associated smoke, forest change may take\nlonger to be detected as clear acquisitions can be sometimes separated by weeks to months.\n\nSpatially explicit AGB can be estimated through remote sensing techniques over large spatial extents (Lu et al., 2016), often with options for temporal repetition to track changes over time. Optical, radar, and light detection and ranging (lidar) sensors can be used to derive AGB (Lu et al., 2016), with lidar, especially airborne lidar, being understood as the most accurate (Bell et al., 2018; Goetz and Dubayah, 2011). As airborne lidar data are not commonly available across large areas or as time series, in part due to their high cost, they are often used in conjunction with medium spatial resolution optical satellite imagery to map forest biomass over large spatial extents (Coops et al., 2021), both regionally (Babcock et al., 2018; Jim√©nez et al., 2017) and nationally (Matasci et al., 2018b). Alternatively, when lidar has been unavailable, studies have shown the feasibility of estimating AGB change based on Landsat (Nguyen et al., 2020) or Sentinel-2 (Puliti et al., 2021) data. Most time series-related research has focused on inter-annual AGB changes (Kennedy et al., 2018; Matasci et al., 2018b; Nguyen et al., 2020; Puliti et al., 2021; Wulder et al., 2020), while less frequently considering finer temporal (intra-year) AGB dynamics. AGB dynamics is the constant process of forest loss and gain and is defined herein as the balance between both AGB loss, caused by forest disturbances, and AGB gain due to vegetation growth (in Tg or Pg). Information on intra-year AGB dynamics is of value to improve our understanding of underlying ecological processes (Gibert et al., 2023; Lohbeck et al., 2015). Moreover, understanding how AGB changes with forest growth and forest loss can be critical for predicting and managing wildfires as high AGB during dry seasons can increase fire fuel loads and thereby increase fire risk and severity (Amato et al., 2013). These risks can be mitigated by real-time AGB estimates that can be useful for fire management strategies and fire behaviour modelling (Aragoneses and Chuvieco, 2021).\n\nHaving multiple observations of the same location over a growing season is expected to offer opportunities for detection and confirmation of change. Robust detection and attribution of forest change utilizing combined Landsat and Sentinel-2 observations can be applied to generate estimates of AGB dynamics. As such, in this study, we develop a reliable and consistent approach to monitor intra-year stand-replacing forest change that can in turn be applied to understand the dynamics of aboveground treed biomass. To test and prototype our approach, we track and quantify AGB loss in 2019, initialized using a 2018 AGB map as a baseline (Matasci et al., 2018a). To characterize AGB gain over undisturbed forests, we used per-pixel annual expected AGB increment values derived from the AGB time series observed increments to estimate 2019 AGB values for undisturbed pixels (Wulder et al., 2020). In so doing, we can document the AGB losses resulting from stand-replacing disturbances and the AGB gains over undisturbed forests. Using the realized 2018 AGB and a modelled representation for 2019 allows us to test this approach for future implementation in NRT mode. Therefore, the objectives of this research were to (1) design a novel change detection algorithm that could take input from multiple sensors (Landsat and Sentinel-2) and detect and attribute stand-replacing forest change in NRT across Canada's forested ecosystems; and to (2) subsequently combine the mapped intra-year forest change with a pre-existing spatially explicit map of AGB to characterize AGB dynamics from May 30 to September 1. Combining the change information with AGB data allows for forest-ecosystem-wide insights on punctual losses due to stand-replacing disturbance as well as AGB increases in undisturbed areas.\n\n## 2. Materials\n\n### 2.1. Study area\n\nOur analysis was conducted on the treed areas located within the twelve forest-dominated ecozones of Canada, which are an assemblage of trees, wetlands, and lakes occupying an area of over 650 Mha (Wulder"

These boreal and hemiboreal ecosystems have varying climatic and ecological conditions resulting in regional variability in terms of tree species, stand structure, productivity, and growing conditions (Brandt et al., 2013; Wulder et al., 2020).\n\nAcross Canada, forest management, including activities such as timber harvesting and fire suppression, is common in southern latitudes, while northern forests remain mostly unmanaged. In terms of forest disturbances, wildfires and harvesting activities are the main cause of stand-replacing events (White et al., 2017) and have the greatest impact on AGB. Although the extent of wildfires can largely vary, on average they affect $\\sim 1.61$ Mha of forest annually (White et al., 2017) or 0.056 Pg of AGB out of a total estimated 27.32 Pg of AGB for Canada's forested ecozones (Wulder et al., 2020). In contrast, harvest activities impact an annual average of $\\sim 0.64$ Mha (White et al., 2017), generally occurring in more productive forests, and resulting in an average AGB removal of 0.054 Pg (Wulder et al., 2020). Finally, non-stand-replacing disturbances (e.g., pests, defoliation, water stress) often lead to incremental and/or subtle impact, and affect on average 0.91 Mha per year (Hermosilla et al., 2019) leading to an annual average removal of 0.01 Pg of AGB (Wulder et al., 2020).\n\n### 2.2. Treed mask\n\nA treed mask was used to separate treed pixels from other land cover types. The Canada-wide, $30-\\mathrm{m}$, land cover map used to delineate the treed mask was produced with the Virtual Land Cover Engine (VLCE) framework, driven by annual change information from Landsat imagery,\nand with an overall accuracy of $77.9 \\% \\pm 1.4 \\%$ (Hermosilla et al., 2022; Hermosilla et al., 2018). The VLCE has 12 land cover classes with four of them representing treed vegetation: Wetland-Treed, Coniferous, Broadleaf, and Mixedwood. To be included in the treed mask, and subsequently in the analysis, a pixel had to be categorized as treed in 2018 as conveyed at the pixel level with one of the four VLCE treed classes.\n\n### 2.3. Image data\n\nFor the analysis, we used surface reflectance data from Landsat-8 (LANDSAT/LC08/C01/T1_SR), and Sentinel-2A and -2B satellites (COPERNICUS/S2_SR_HARMONIZED), with $<70 \\%$ cloud cover per scene, as available on Google Earth Engine (Gorelick et al., 2017). For each image, we retained the pixels falling within the treed mask and discarded cloudy pixels. For Landsat images, the quality assurance (QA) band was used to remove pixels indicated as opaque or as cirrus clouds, while the s2cloudless algorithm was used for Sentinel-2 images to remove cloudy pixels based on cloud probability images (Braaten et al., 2020). As required for the change detection routine applied (described in Section 3.1.2), we used images from 2017 to 2019. For each year, all images obtained between May 30 and September 17 were gathered to relate changes occurring since the end of the last growing season as identified by the 2018 C2C map (Hermosilla et al., 2016) and up to September 1, 2019. Images from 2017 and 2018 were used to provide baseline status information for the capture of changes attributed to 2019.\n![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)\n\nFig. 1.

(2018b), which used Landsat composites and a national collection of lidar plots (Wulder et al., 2012) to generate spatially-explicit maps of forest structures. This approach to model AGB was first regionally demonstrated by Zald et al. (2016) who used Nearest Neighborhood imputation to link surface reflectance from Landsat imagery to co-located airborne lidar samples. The methods were extended spatially over the boreal forest by Matasci et al. (2018b) that calibrated and validated models to estimate on a 30-m pixel basis forest structure metrics, and subsequently over the entirety of Canada's forested ecosystems (Matasci et al., 2018a). Accuracy for the AGB products was assessed using independent samples of lidar plots for a reported $\\mathrm{R}^{2}$ of 0.699, RMSE\\% of 65.8 and bias of -0.66 (Matasci et al., 2018a). Wulder et al. (2020) utilized the data from Matasci et al. (2018b) to document AGB dynamics by disturbance type and AGB recovery across Canada's forested ecosystems dating back to 1984.\n\n## 3. Methods\n\nTo quantify intra-year AGB change, the workflow followed four steps, consisting of 1) assembling satellite data in annual image time series, 2) using a change detection algorithm to identify candidatechanged pixels, 3) attributing a type of stand-replacing disturbance to change, and 4) calculating AGB dynamics. The first three steps were grouped within the Tracking Intra- and Inter-year Change (TIIC) algorithm, a multi-source change detection approach developed to identify stand-replacing changes across Canada's forested ecozones throughout a growing season.\n\n### 3.1. Tracking Intra- and Inter-year Change\n\n### 3.1.1.

      "markdown": "candidate-changed pixels. Two pairs of time series (i.e., expectation and target) are used to continually assess the change status of a pixel: one pair for the normalized burn ratio (NBR; Key and Benson, 2006) and another pair for the shortwave infrared (SWIR) band of each sensor (Landsat-8, Band 7 - SWIR 2; Sentinel-2, Band 12 - SWIR). The time series cover the entire study area with images acquired from May 30 to September 17. The expectation time series are used to determine the expected values in each pixel throughout the summer, which serves as a baseline trend to compare to the target time series values in order to identify candidate-changed pixels. Two years of images $(2017,2018)$ for the same range of dates were used to build the expectation time series to ensure sufficient data to fit a first-order periodic curve. For example, the use of two years for the expectation time series yielded twice the number of data points for the pixel in Fig. 2A and shows the stability of NBR from year to year if there are no disturbances within that pixel. In addition to the NBR expectation time series (Fig. 2A) for a given pixel, Fig. 2 shows a probable change at the end of July due to the sudden drop in the NBR target time series (Fig. 2B). In parallel, for the same pixel, another pair of time series is used to identify candidate-changed pixels for the SWIR bands (Fig. 2E-F).\n\nNBR, a ratio between the near infrared and the SWIR bands, was used due to its stable patterns intra- and inter-annually when forests are undisturbed as evidenced in Fig. 2A (Cardille et al., 2022). As such, NBR has been shown to accurately discriminate between undisturbed and disturbed forests (i.e., harvest and fires), as a stand-replacing disturbance usually results in a markedly lower spectral response than\nundisturbed forests (Schroeder et al., 2011; Whitman et al., 2018). The spectral response following a fire disturbance is different than the one following a timber harvesting activity (Schroeder et al., 2011). NBR was initially conceptualized to analyze burn severity and therefore uses spectral band passes aimed at capturing the change in spectral response for this type of disturbance (Key and Benson, 2006). To better capture timber harvesting activities characterized by a smaller NBR change postdisturbance, we integrated the SWIR band in the change detection routine, as the increase in the SWIR spectral response is greater following a harvesting activity than a fire (Schroeder et al., 2011). Thus, we used another pair of target and expectation image collections, assessing the stability of the SWIR band used in the NBR calculation, to capture non-fire related stand-replacing disturbances (Fig. 2). In the end, a candidate-changed pixel could be associated with an increase in the SWIR spectral response and/or a decrease of the NBR, depending on the type of stand-replacing disturbance.\n\n### 3.1.2. Change detection\n\nWith every new image added to a target time series, TIIC was designed to detect whether a treed pixel was changed or not based on the baseline set by the expectation time series. TIIC is built with two components: one that employs the Bayesian Updating of Land Cover algorithm (BULC), and a second that interprets the results by parsing candidate-changed pixels (Fig. 3; Table 1).\n\nThe BULC algorithm was designed to enable the combination of multiple depictions of a given phenomenon to determine a more robust\n![img-2.jpeg](img-2.jpeg)\n\nFig. 3. Overview of the change detection stages of TIIC. Time series of Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR) and shortwave infrared (SWIR) are processed separately using these steps before the candidate-changed pixels are combined in one image at the end of this process. The example here is for the NBR. In this figure, the images associated with the expectation and target time series are produced by mosaicking all images in the time series."

We used the BULC algorithm to assess the temporal stability of the NBR and the SWIR band based on a pixelspecific Z-score calculated for every image in the target time series with the reference mean and standard deviation derived from the expectation time series (Fig. 2C and G). The series of Z-scores were input to BULC, which then updated the running probability of a change for an individual treed pixel. The probability of a forest change was then updated for each new NBR and SWIR values from the target image collection, with the final product being a probability vector of change. The vector of change contains three probability values through the analysis period, relating: decreased NBR/increased SWIR, stable NBR/ SWIR, and increased NBR/decreased SWIR (Fig. 2D and H).\n\nUsing a sensitivity analysis on national change/no-change samples, we established the threshold values to identify change and no change pixels. A treed pixel would be a candidate for change if the probability of decreased NBR or the probability of increased SWIR exceeded 0.5. For all candidate pixels, we removed unlikely candidates based on national thresholds (i.e., change pixels found outside of the candidate-changed pixel area in Fig. 4). For the NBR time series, a pixel required a postchange NBR mean $<0.3$ and a differentiated NBR (dNBR $=$ prechange NBR - post-change NBR) $>0.3$. If either of those conditions were not met, pixels were flagged as no change. Similarly, for the SWIR time series, the post-change SWIR had to be $>950$ and the dNBR had to be $>0.2$. In this context, dNBR was used to ensure that the difference between pre- and post-NBR was sufficiently large to potentially qualify as a stand-replacing change, as considering only NBR to select candidatechanged pixels could lead to pixels with a low pre-disturbance NBR value to be incorrectly identified as changed with a small decrease in NBR.\n\nWe then estimated the date of the change using the probability vector of change (Fig. 5), which also allowed us to determine postchange NBR/SWIR. Within the pixel series, we identified the approximate date at which the probability of decreased NBR/increased SWIR started increasing significantly. We found that the earliest date at which we could detect the change was when the probability of decreased NBR/ increased SWIR exceeded 0.3. This threshold was used because the probability would rarely decrease once it exceeded 0.3 , which was not the case for lower probabilities. For example, due to clouds, shadows, haze or smoke, the probability of decreased NBR/increased SWIR could increase to 0.22 and then subsequently decrease to 0.1 . The timing of change was therefore estimated once the probability of decreased NBR/ increased SWIR exceeded the 0.5 threshold for change, by referencing back to the date the probability exceeded 0.3 and marking that date as when the change was confirmed (Fig. 5). Every new image added to the collection after the day of change was included in the calculation for the post-change mean. Finally, as mentioned above, we kept candidatechanged pixels with a date of change between May 30 and September 1.\n\nWe partitioned the analysis period into multiple time steps to track forest variables within a growing season. Based on the day of confirmed change, we grouped changed pixels into ten temporal windows (T1 to T10), wherein each window represented a span of 10 days, with T1 starting at the beginning of the growing season on May 30.\n\n### 3.1.3. Change typing\n\nCandidate-changed pixels were attributed to a change type using a decision tree in Google Earth Engine. We focused on the two main causes\nof stand-replacing disturbances in Canada: wildfires and mechanical removals. The latter included timber harvesting activities and disturbances from roads and oil and gas well-sites. To assign a type of change to a candidate-changed pixel, we used post-change NBR for fires and post-change SWIR for the mechanically removed class. To differentiate fire and mechanically removed disturbances based on their post-change spectral reflectance, we sampled disturbed treed pixels across Canada's forested ecozones (Fig. 6). Based on the sampled pixels, we designed a four-node decision tree to attribute a change type to candidate-changed pixels (Fig. 7). The first two branches of the decision tree were used to classify events resulting in greater spectral changes: the fire class was assigned to pixels that had a post-change NBR mean lower than -0.05 , and the mechanically removed class was assigned to pixels that had a post-change SWIR mean higher than 1750. The two lower branches were used to classify events with smaller spectral changes: the fire class for pixels with a post-change NBR mean lower than 0.05 and mechanically removed for pixels with a post-change SWIR mean higher than 1250. We found that if only two branches were used in the decision tree, some events were wrongly classified (Fig. 6). During the attribution of a type to change, pixels that did not meet the spectral criteria for fire or mechanically removed classes were grouped in a third class named unclassified changes, likely due to non-stand-replacing events.\n\nAcross the candidate-changed pixels areas, change type was assigned at the pixel level. To ensure that spatially adjacent pixels would have a matching disturbance type, a 300 m radius square kernel (equivalent to ten 30 m pixels on each side of a pixel) mode filter was passed over the result of the classification tree. Disturbances that were associated with the unclassified change type, most likely due to non-stand-replacing disturbances, were excluded from the analysis as the focus of this research is on stand-replacing changes. Additionally, at this stage, we removed change events that were smaller than the minimum mapping unit of 0.5 ha (Hermosilla et al., 2016). Through the TIIC protocol outlined, we produced a map of the 2019 forest changes and change types. For the occurrence change map, pixels could be assigned one of two classes (no change or change), while the map with change types had three map classes (no change, fire, and mechanical removal). For uniformity across the study area and to accommodate the different spatial resolutions of Landsat and Sentinel-2, the final change maps were resampled to 30 m .\n\n### 3.1.4. Accuracy assessment\n\nTo assess the change detection accuracy of the TIIC protocol, we followed the guidelines outlined in Olofsson et al. (2020) by stratifying the treed pixels of the study area in three exhaustive and nonoverlapping strata: undisturbed forest, disturbed forest, and buffer. The use of a spatial buffer has been shown to reduce the weight of omission errors that frequently occur near changed pixels. Indeed, in remote sensing-based mapping, omission errors can have a disproportionate effect on area estimates of rare phenomena like forest change in an extent as large as the Canadian forested ecozones. The efficiency of the buffer relies on the equilibrium between its overall weight defined by its size and the number of errors that it captures. For this analysis, the spatial buffer had a size equivalent to two resampled 30-m pixels outside the edges of pixels mapped as changed for an overall width of 60 m .\n\nWe sampled randomly in each ecozone and within each of the three strata. A total of 70030 -m sample units were selected with $55 \\%$ of the sample units allocated to the undisturbed forest and buffer stratum, which occupied most of the study area, and $35 \\%$ allocated to the"

Two interpreters, without prior knowledge of the map classes to which a sample unit was associated, independently assessed the reference images, as well as the shape and area of the change in the case of a disturbance. For mechanical removal of trees, disturbance edges tend to be rectilinear while fire edges are more stochastic. Further, using a short-wave infrared band combination, fire was usually characterized by a darker colour than mechanical removal due to the resulting different spectral change (Schroeder et al., 2011). Some sample units ( $7 \\%$ of the total samples) were cross-referenced between interpreters to ensure consistency and\nunbiased interpretation. For each sample unit, at least one interpreter recorded: whether the pixel was treed; if the pixel was treed, was it changed or not changed; if the pixel was changed, the type of disturbance (i.e., wildfire, mechanical removal); the date of the image when the disturbance was first clearly visible and the image date prior to the disturbance. The confidence levels (1-5) associated with the attribution of the sample unit's attributes were also recorded and sample units that were not treed or with low classification confidence ( $<3$ ) were discarded. This resulted in a total of 679 sample units used in the analysis: 465 in the undisturbed forest stratum, 185 in the disturbed forest stratum, and 29 in the buffer stratum.\n\nChange detection and change typing accuracies were assessed with distinct confusion matrices as the map and reference classification could agree about the change detection but disagree on the change typing. Included in the confusion matrices were unbiased changed area estimates and unbiased estimates of the overall, user's and producer's accuracies, following Stehman (2014) recommendations when mapped classes (change and no change) and sample strata (undisturbed forest, disturbed forest, and buffer) are different. As the interpreters recorded the date of the first image after a forest disturbance, we calculated the accuracy present at each time step throughout the growing season, as well as for the end-of-season change map.\n\n### 3.2. Application: Intra-year change in aboveground treed biomass\n\nTo demonstrate the utility of the within-year change outputs generated using TIIC, we investigated intra-year AGB dynamics. Therefore, we paired our change map informing on change occurrence, type, and timing with a 2018 treed AGB map of Canada's forested ecosystems. When a change occurred as identified by TIIC, we assigned a null AGB to the changed pixel, assuming that a stand-replacing change would lead to an almost complete or eventual depletion of AGB. Within each temporal window, the AGB associated with changed pixels was added to sum up the AGB loss within that span of 10 days. For the pixels that were not affected by stand-replacing disturbances and were treed in 2018 and remained treed for each time step of the 2019 growing season, AGB gain stemming from vegetation growth was added to the 2018 AGB. The AGB gain was derived for each pixel based on the pixel's annual historical growth rate for the 10-year period 2009-2018, as"

Annual increments were pro-rated by the total number of 10-day periods assessed through the growing season (i. e., 10). Therefore, for unchanged pixels, an AGB increment, unique to each pixel's AGB trajectory, was added at each temporal window. The average annual per-pixel increment ranged from $0.10 \\mathrm{Mg}(\\mathrm{sd}=0.18 \\mathrm{Mg})$ in the Taiga Shield East, to 0.59 Mg ( $\\mathrm{sd}=0.95 \\mathrm{Mg}$ ) in the Pacific Maritime. The national average annual AGB increment over all of Canada's treed area is $0.23 \\mathrm{Mg} /$ pixel $(\\mathrm{sd}=0.43 \\mathrm{Mg})$. Intra-year AGB dynamics were reported for each temporal window by change type and forested ecozone. We also characterized inter-annual AGB dynamics from 2018 to 2019.\n\n## 4. Results\n\n### 4.1. Tracking Intra- and Inter-year Change\n\n### 4.1.1. Overall change across Canada's forests\n\nApplication of the TIIC algorithm indicated that $>2.71$ Mha of treed area underwent stand-replacing disturbances in Canada's forested ecosystems that can be attributed to the 2019 growing season (Fig. 8). Approximately $67 \\%$ of the area was disturbed by fires ( 1.82 Mha ), whereas $33 \\%$ ( 0.90 Mha ) was disturbed by the mechanical removal of trees (Table 2). The Boreal Plains and Montane Cordillera were the ecozones that experienced the greatest area loss to fires, with $>0.43$ Mha affected in each ecozone (Table 2). The highest area change from the mechanical removal of trees was in the Boreal Shield East ( 0.25 Mha ), which is also the largest ecozone (Table 2). The Montane Cordillera was second in terms of disturbed area from mechanical removal of trees in 2019 ( 0.19 Mha ) in addition to the large area disturbed by fires.\n\nIn 2019, 0.75\\% of Canada's total treed area was impacted by standreplacing disturbances. $>50 \\%$ ( 0.14 Mha ) of the 2019 disturbed area was confirmed by June 20 (i.e., within the first two 10-day temporal windows of the analysis period; Fig. 9). Of that 0.14 Mha, 0.08 Mha were typed as fire and 0.06 Mha were typed as mechanical removal of trees. The highest amount of disturbed area was confirmed during the second temporal window (June 10 to June 19) for both types of disturbance, with 0.07 Mha disturbed by fires and 0.03 Mha disturbed by the mechanical removal of trees.\n\n### 4.1.2. Accuracy assessment\n\nThe accuracy assessment indicated that TIIC produced a highly reliable map of stand-replacing changes for 2019 in treed areas across Canadian forested ecozones (Table 3). Overall accuracy was 0.99 ( $\\pm$ $0.00,95 \\%$-confidence interval) with a user's accuracy of $0.97( \\pm 0.01)$ for the disturbed areas and a producer's accuracy of $0.98( \\pm 0.04)$. False positives were often located in mountainous areas or in areas that experienced more variability due to seasonality or dryness. False negatives were located in the buffer stratum at the edges of changed pixels, which limited the impact of the errors on the reported accuracies. The overall accuracy for the change typing assessment was $0.99( \\pm 0.01)$ (Table 4). The fire class had a user's accuracy of $0.99( \\pm 0.01)$ and a producer's accuracy of $0.99( \\pm 0.01)$ while the mechanically removed"

Application: Intra-year change in aboveground treed biomass\n\n### 4.2.1. Overall change\n\nAt the national scale, approximately 26 Pg of AGB were found in the treed area of Canada's forested ecosystems at the end of the 2018 growing season. By the end of 2019, the AGB increased to 26.66 Pg , which represented an increase of 0.66 Pg . For each forested ecozone, we calculated the overall AGB loss and gain (Table 5). Every ecozone had a net annual positive AGB balance for 2019. The ecozones with the largest AGB losses were the Montane Cordillera ( 0.07 Pg ) and Boreal Plains ( 0.04 Pg ), while the greatest AGB gain was found in the Boreal Shield East ( 0.16 Pg ) and Montane Cordillera ( 0.14 Pg ). Overall, the average gain in treed AGB was 0.09 Pg per 10-day period (standard deviation $=$ 5.00 Tg ), whereas the average loss was 0.02 Pg per 10-day period (standard deviation $=20 \\mathrm{Tg}$ ). In terms of AGB density loss, the greatest AGB losses were found in the Montane Cordillera ( $2.02 \\mathrm{Mg} / \\mathrm{ha}$ ), Boreal Cordillera ( $1.17 \\mathrm{Mg} / \\mathrm{ha}$ ), and Boreal Plains ( $1.02 \\mathrm{Mg} / \\mathrm{ha}$ ). Conversely, the highest AGB density gain was found in the Pacific Maritime ( 6.36 $\\mathrm{Mg} / \\mathrm{ha}$ ) and Montane Cordillera ( $4.47 \\mathrm{Mg} / \\mathrm{ha}$ ), which are home to some of the most productive forests in Canada (White et al., 2017).\n\nFig. 12 shows the AGB loss that resulted from forest changes due to fire and harvesting activities in the same area of interest used in Fig. 10. The 2018 baseline AGB (Fig. 12A) was affected by intra-year standreplacing disturbances (Fig. 12D), but also experienced vegetation growth in the undisturbed pixels which led to AGB gains (Fig. 12C), resulting in the AGB for year 2019 (Fig. 12B).\n\n### 4.2.2. Temporal AGB dynamics\n\nOverall, the average loss in treed AGB was 13.75 Tg per 10-day period (standard deviation $=14.75 \\mathrm{Tg}$ ) for fire and 7.57 Tg per 10 day period (standard deviation $=10.06 \\mathrm{Tg}$ ) for mechanical removal. Fire disturbances resulted in greater AGB losses on western ecozones such as the Montane Cordillera ( 42.30 Tg ), Boreal Plains ( 29.24 Tg ) and Boreal Cordillera ( 28.19 Tg ). $64 \\%$ of AGB loss attributed to fire was detected within the first month of the analysis period. Eastern ecozones like the Atlantic Maritime ( 0.03 Tg ) and the Taiga Shield East ( 0.08 Tg ) had small AGB losses as a result of fires. Mechanical removal was more prevalent in the southern ecozones (Fig. 13) due to more intensive forest management practices. $80 \\%$ of the AGB loss associated with the mechanical removal of trees occurred during the first month of the analysis period. The timing of these changes is predominantly related to overwinter harvesting activities across the country (Cardille et al., 2022).\n\nFig. 13 displays, for each Canada's forested ecozone, the AGB loss per type of change and time window in the growing season starting on May 30, 2019. In northernmost ecozones, such as the Taiga Shield East and Taiga Cordillera, the change attributed to the mechanical removal type appeared stochastic, possibly due to false positives. Fig. 14 shows the gross AGB loss and the net AGB gain or loss per time window and ecozone. The results indicate that for any given time window the AGB gains were generally larger than the AGB losses. While most ecozones consistently showed a positive net AGB balance, the Boreal Plains and Montane Cordillera had a negative AGB balance during the month of June (i.e., T1, T2 and T3).\n\n## 5. Discussion\n\n### 5.1. Tracking intra- and inter-year change\n\nWith TIIC, a multi-source change detection approach, we demonstrated the feasibility of monitoring forest changes in near-real time across Canada's forested ecozones throughout a growing season. Dense time series of Landsat and Sentinel-2 images processed with cloud computing technologies have allowed for this spatially extensive and temporally fine analysis of forest change. In our analysis and attributable to 2019, we estimated that 1.8 Mha of Canada's treed area was disturbed by forest fires while 0.9 Mha was disturbed by the mechanical"

      "markdown": "removal of trees. Applied in NRT mode, the ability to nationally estimate changed areas within the same growing season will greatly reduce the latency often associated with the production of change maps that rely on trend-based analysis approaches (Giannetti et al., 2020; Hermosilla et al., 2016), albeit without the additional information regarding longterm change characteristics (e.g., change persistence, directionality, magnitude, and rates). The integration of within-year low latency change capture, such as that demonstrated herein, with long-term trendbased analysis is a topic worthy of additional investigation.\n\nOur analysis of the accuracy through time showed that TIIC requires approximately 30 days to capture most of the changes that have occurred since the end of the previous growing season (Fig. 11), owing to the increase in observations that comes from combining Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 data. This time lag suggests a shorter period to detect change than NRT algorithms such as S-CCD (Ye et al., 2021) and COLD (Zhu et al., 2020), both of which rely exclusively on Landsat data and respectively require 80 and 96 days to confirm a change. TIIC's required period to confirm a change is similar to NRT algorithms like NRTMONITOR, which requires 35 days on average (Shang et al., 2022) and which also uses both Sentinel-2 and Landsat data.\n\nOne of the strengths of TIIC is the algorithm's ability to accurately attribute a change type to a disturbance based on the post-change surface reflectance. Accurate typing of forest change is important as recovery differs based on the disturbance agent, which can have implications for forest management (White et al., 2017). When compared to similar works, our producer's accuracy for the fire class (99\\%) combined with a high user's accuracy, was much higher than that reported by Cardille et al. (2022), who also focused on stand-replacing disturbances in Canada. Our producer's accuracy result was comparable to the one reported for fires (93\\%) by Hermosilla et al. (2016), that was based upon a time series of annually representative, mid-summer, reflectance BAP composites. We reached a producer's accuracy of 96\\% for the mechanical removal of trees, which mainly included timber harvesting events, similar to the result reported by Hermosilla et al. (2016) for harvesting disturbances (88\\%). The change detection approach demonstrated herein uses several images within a year that allow for an initial detection and confirmation of a given change, thus resulting in greater accuracies, as illustrated in Fig. 11.\n\nWhile the accuracy assessment indicated a good performance of the TIIC algorithm, there are some limitations including spatial resolution, portability, and detection period. Like other algorithms that combine Sentinel-2 and Landsat data to increase temporal frequency (e.g., Shang et al., 2022), the higher spatial resolution of Sentinel-2 (i.e., 10 m and 20 m ) is sacrificed when the change layer is resampled to uniform 30-m pixels. In the future, fusion methods could possibly be used to downscale Landsat imagery to 10 m to retain a higher spatial resolution (Shao et al., 2019). The thresholds used to produce the change maps were selected from observations of forest changes across Canada's forested ecozones. While these thresholds might not be optimal regionally in Canada, there are opportunities for recalibration to adapt TIIC to specific regional conditions across the country or around the world where there might be other predominant disturbance types. Finally, TIIC is best suited for monitoring boreal forest change during a specific period of the year, as a function of the remote sensing limitations associated with cloud, snow cover and low-sun angles present during the winter. Overwinter changes are still detected at the beginning of the following growing season, but the timing of the changes to a time window over the winter is not attempted.\n\n### 5.2. Application: Intra-year change in aboveground treed biomass\n\nWith our map of forest stand-replacing disturbances, we quantified AGB dynamics across the 2019 growing season in Canada's forested ecozones. Overall, the annual treed AGB increased from 26 Pg to 26.66 Pg nationally, showing that despite mechanical removals and forest fires, the growth of vegetation in undisturbed forests was able to offset\nreductions in AGB. For the disturbed treed areas, 64\\% of the AGB loss due to fires and $80 \\%$ of AGB loss to mechanical removal were confirmed during the month of June, with the largest AGB losses happening in the western ecozones (i.e., Montane Cordillera and Boreal Plains). The results presented herein demonstrate the importance of assessing AGB dynamics at finer spatio-temporal intervals coincident with ecological processes (Duncanson et al., 2019).\n\nAs previous studies have shown, there is value in understanding the spatial distribution of forest disturbances and the subsequent effect on AGB (e.g., Coops et al., 2020; Nguyen et al., 2020; Wulder et al., 2020), but AGB temporal variation within a year has rarely been explored. At a finer temporal scale (i.e., weekly, monthly), large AGB losses are not always counterbalanced by AGB gain. Only measuring AGB for June 2019 would lead to a conclusion of net AGB loss, whereas when the entire growing season is analyzed, a net AGB gain is realized. As such, there is value to intra-year AGB measurements as they can relate both the timing and size of the effect of forest disturbances on AGB, such as fires or mechanical removal.\n\nAnnual AGB loss exhibits large inter-annual variability that can be masked by long-term averages as we observed when comparing our results with long-term trends. Indeed, over the analysis period, we found that 0.21 Pg of AGB was lost across Canadian forested ecozones, which was high compared to the long-term trend of annual AGB loss ( $0.12 \\mathrm{Pg} /$ year; Wulder et al., 2020). The high rate of AGB loss for 2019 was largely driven by the AGB loss due to fires in the Montane Cordillera that occurred in 2018 and after the detection window used for mapping (i.e., August $1 \\pm 30$ days; Hermosilla et al., 2016). Annual AGB loss is highly variable from one year to the next, especially for AGB lost to forest fires, akin to the annual area impacted (White et al., 2017). For example, in the Montane Cordillera, the long-term annual rate of AGB loss due to fire was previously reported to be approximately $0.003 \\mathrm{Pg} /$ year (Wulder et al., 2020), whereas we calculated a loss of $0.042 \\mathrm{Pg} /$ year of AGB to fires, again demonstrating the high variability that can arise annually in terms of AGB loss. More generally, the 2019 annual AGB losses reported herein were higher across all ecozones and forest types than the longterm trends reported by Wulder et al. (2020). However, even with a positive AGB balance by the end of the 2019 growing season, the overall treed AGB at the end of 2019 remained lower than the 2016 AGB of 27.32 Pg reported in Wulder et al. (2020) following two of the largest fire seasons on record in the province of British Columbia (2017 and 2018; Natural Resources Canada, 2020).\n\nSome non-stand-replacing changes may have been misidentified as stand-replacing and may have contributed to inflated AGB values for the mechanically removed disturbances, especially in the northern latitudes and in mountainous or dry areas. For example, we reported that 0.21 Tg of AGB were lost due to the mechanical removal of trees in the Taiga Shield West, which is unlikely as timber harvesting operations are rare at these latitudes (White et al., 2022). As reported by Coops et al. (2020), some of the northern ecozones (i.e., Taiga Shield East, Taiga Shield West and Hudson Plains) have a higher occurrence of non-stand-replacing change events. Non-stand-replacing changes are spectrally more difficult to separate from stand-replacing changes such as timber harvesting (Cohen et al., 2017), which was likely the situation for pixels attributed to the mechanically removed type in these ecozones.\n\nMapping disturbance drivers is essential to understand the biomass consequence of a change (Williams et al., 2016). This study highlighted previously reported findings that harvesting is more prevalent in productive forests while fires happen in more heterogenous environments (White et al., 2017). As our results showed, the extent of the area disturbed by the mechanical removal of trees ( 0.9 Mha ) was half that disturbed by forest fires ( 1.8 Mha ). However, the AGB loss due to fire ( 137.5 Tg ) was less than twice that of the AGB loss to mechanical removal ( 76.7 Tg ). Insight into the drivers of AGB loss can therefore increase our understanding of recovery rates that have been shown to be higher in areas disturbed by timber harvesting compared to firedisturbed areas (Madoui et al., 2015; White et al., 2017)."

      "markdown": "Regarding trends in the timing of AGB loss, most of the AGB loss, akin to area changed, was confirmed before the end of June, with around 0.087 Pg lost due to fire disturbances and 0.061 Pg lost due to the mechanical removal of trees. Although timber harvesting can happen yearround in Canada, an important share of harvest operations takes place during the winter (for reduced fire risk and for transport across seasonally impassible frozen grounds (Gaulton et al., 2011). Our results agreed with that assumption since most of the mechanical removal detected in June included changes that happened throughout the winter when ground snow prevents image analysis opportunities.\n\nWithin our representation of ecozone-specific dynamics, the timing of AGB loss per time step was better estimated than the timing of AGB gain. In general, as emphasised by Nguyen et al. (2020), predicting AGB gain from spectral imagery, especially at such small temporal intervals, is more difficult than estimating AGB loss, as the latter is associated with abrupt spectral changes compared to the former. Hence, the AGB gain per time step was derived from the long-term average annual positive increment in AGB where we assumed a linear increase (see methods) without consideration of potential seasonality effects, within the defined growing season, on the timing of forest growth.\n\nWhereas TIIC detected within-year stand-replacing change accurately, we did not consider non-stand-replacing changes. Non-standreplacing disturbances, like drought, fungus and insects, often translate to subtle spectral changes that are harder to capture with optical data and that can affect forests for multiple growing seasons (Cohen et al., 2016; Coops et al., 2020; Hall et al., 2016). On average, non-standreplacing disturbances lead to AGB density losses $-0.67 \\mathrm{Mg} \\mathrm{yr}^{-1} \\mathrm{ha}^{-1}$, compared to stand-replacing disturbances that result in combined AGB losses of $-4 \\mathrm{Mg} \\mathrm{yr}^{-1} \\mathrm{ha}^{-1}$ (Wulder et al., 2020). In this analysis, we focused on abrupt changes like fires and the mechanical removal of trees because they may be detected accurately and their AGB consequences are greater, have long-term implications, and are more readily quantified. Future research could investigate the inclusion of non-standreplacing changes in the workflow to develop a more comprehensive AGB monitoring system (Kennedy et al., 2018).\n\n## 6. Conclusion\n\nIn this research, we leveraged data from Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2A and -2B to demonstrate capacity for a near-real time forest change detection algorithm, the Tracking of Intra- and Inter-year Change (TIIC). Applied to Canada's forested ecozones, our results demonstrate how TIIC can accurately monitor stand-replacing forest changes within a given year at a 10-day time step, enabling a temporally detailed assessment of forest change through the growing season. As a demonstration of an application afforded by intra-year forest change information, we generated a detailed accounting of AGB dynamics-by change type-for the 2019 growing season. The application of intra-year change information in a near-real time mode illustrated how the rapid capture of AGB consequences of different disturbance types can be quantified, as well as the relaying within-year variability in AGB dynamics and complementing information on long-term trends derived from time series monitoring over several decades.\n\n## CRediT authorship contribution statement\n\nFlavie Pelletier: Conceptualization, Methodology, Software, Validation, Writing - original draft, Visualization.
