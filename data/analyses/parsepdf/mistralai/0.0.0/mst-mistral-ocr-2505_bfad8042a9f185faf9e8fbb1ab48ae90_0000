Latent Class Growth Analyses was used to identify anhedonia trajectories. Trajectory differences in associations between clinical features and functional connectivity (FC) of the ventral striatum (VS) during a reward fMRI task were examined.\nResults: Three anhedonia trajectory groups emerged: (1) High and Stable Anhedonia trajectory (intercept: Est=-60.10, SE=3.45; slope: Est=-0.33, SE=1.34, p=0.81), (2) Moderate and Decreasing Anhedonia (intercept: Est=-74.99, SE=3.48; slope: Est=3.46, SE=0.75, p < 0.001), and (3) Low and Decreasing Anhedonia (intercept: Est=91.59, SE=4.23; slope: Est=2.75, SE=0.82, $\\mathrm{p}=0.001$ ). Adolescents in the Low and Decreasing Anhedonia trajectory had lower suicidal ideation (SI) and tended to be at high familial risk ( $p<0.05$ ). For the High and Stable Anhedonia trajectory only, higher SI was related to negative VS FC with dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, paracentral lobule, inferior parietal lobe, and supplementary motor area ( $p<0.05$ ).\nConclusions: Anhedonia's course may impact SI and neural reward circuitry. Results highlight the complexity in anhedonia development and the value of frontostriatal circuitry for understanding clinical correlates of anhedonia over time.\nFunding Source: NIH R01MH104418 to EEF, K23MH128728 to KE, and T32MH018269 to TG\nKeywords: Adolescence, Anhedonia, Developmental Trajectories, Suicidal Ideation, Reward\n\n## 294. Developmental Differences in Striatal Recruitment by Reward Prospects as a Function of Attentional Demand\n\nChelsea Sawyers ${ }^{1}$, Lisa Straub ${ }^{1}$, Joseph Gauntlett ${ }^{1}$, and James Bjork ${ }^{1}$\n\n## ${ }^{1}$ Virginia Commonwealth University\n\nBackground: Adolescent risk-taking has been attributed to earlier-developing motivational neurocircuitry that is poorly controlled by immature executive-control neurocircuitry. Functional magnetic resonance imaging findings of increased ventral striatum (VS) recruitment by reward prospects in adolescents compared to adults support this theory. Other studies found blunted VS recruitment by reward-predictive cues in adolescents compared to adults. Task features may explain this discrepancy but have never been systematically explored.\nMethods: 35 Adolescents and 32 adults performed a novel fMRI reward task that holds constant the expected value of all rewards but varies whether rewards are dependent on vigilanceintensive responding (monetary incentive delay (MID) versus making a lucky choice during a relaxed response window. We examined group by sub-task differences in activation of VS and more motoric regions of striatum in response to anticipatory cues.\nResults: Reward anticipation in both conditions activated striatal VOI in both groups, however no group differences in VS activation. Adults showed greater activation in dorsal striatum and putamen during reward anticipation, whereas adolescents showed greater activation of the VS during reward notification but lower activation during loss notification.\n\nConclusions: The VOI findings were in accord with our conceptualization of MID-like trials being more attentionally demanding, with increased recruitment of more motoric portions of striatum in contexts that required more vigilance and rapid response. These data extend findings of cross-sectional age-group differences in cue-elicited anticipatory recruitment of striatum, by demonstrating in adults relatively greater recruitment of motor effector regions of striatum by attentional and motor demands.\nFunding Source: R21DA040942\nKeywords: Attentional Control, Adolescents, Reward Neurocircuitry, Monetary Reward, Brain Imaging, fMRI\n\n## 295. Rare Variant Genetic Architecture of the Human Cortical MRI Phenotypes in General Population\n\nKuldeep Kumar ${ }^{1}$, Sayeh Kazem ${ }^{1}$, Zhijie Liao ${ }^{1}$, Jakub Kopal ${ }^{1}$, Guillaume Huguet ${ }^{1}$, Thomas Renne ${ }^{1}$, Martineau Jean-Louis ${ }^{1}$, Zhe Xie ${ }^{1}$, Zohra Saci ${ }^{1}$, Laura Almasy ${ }^{2}$, David Glahn ${ }^{3}$, Tomas Paus ${ }^{1}$, Guillaume Dumas ${ }^{1}$, Carrie Bearden ${ }^{3}$, Paul Thompson ${ }^{3}$, Richard Bethlehem ${ }^{5}$, Varun Warrier ${ }^{5}$, and Sebastien Jacquemont ${ }^{1}$\n\n[^0]Background: The development and organization of the human cortex are influenced by both common and rare variants. While genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified common variants that influence global and regional cortical phenotypes derived using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the rare variant genetic architecture of the human cortex has not yet been characterized, and the relationship between common and rare variant architectures remains unknown. We hypothesize that common and rare variants exert similar influences on cortical phenotypes. Our study aims to map the effects of rare variants on twelve MRI-derived phenotypes, measured globally and regionally.\nMethods: We analyzed structural and diffusion MRI-derived phenotypes and copy-number-variants (CNV) calls ( $<50 \\mathrm{ki}$ lobases) from 40,000 UK Biobank participants. Genes encompassed in CNVs were scored based on published functional gene-sets, such as cell-type marker genes. We performed burden association analysis (linear regressions) to estimate the mean effect size on MRI phenotypes of genes within a gene-set of interest, for deletions and duplications separately. We also estimated burden genetic correlations by correlating the effect sizes between pairs of MRI phenotypes.\nResults: Deletions had approximately 2-fold larger effect sizes than duplications. The burden and common-variant genetic correlations showed a high concordance ( $r=0.84$ ). 10 out of 12 MRI phenotypes showed a negative correlation between deletion and duplication effect size profiles. For cell-type and cortical-layers, deletions and duplications showed opposing effects on the MRI phenotypes.\n\n\n[^0]:    ${ }^{1}$ University of Southern California, ${ }^{6}$ University of Cambridge\n    Keywords: Attention, Control, Adolescents, Reward Neurocircuitry, Monetary Reward, Brain Imaging, fMRI\n\n    ## 295.
