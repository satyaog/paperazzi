Here, we employed a multimodal imaging approach to assess oxygenation changes in the spinal cord of the transgenic M83 murine model of PD overexpressing the mutated A53T alpha-synuclein form in comparison with nontransgenic littermates. Methods In vivo spiral volumetric optoacoustic tomography (SVOT) was performed to assess oxygen saturation $\\left(\\mathrm{sO}_{2}\\right)$ in the spinal cords of M83 mice and non-transgenic littermates. Ex vivo high-field T1-weighted (T1w) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 9.4 T was used to assess volumetric alterations in the spinal cord. 3D SVOT analysis and deep learningbased automatic segmentation of T1w MRI data for the mouse spinal cord were developed for quantification. Immunostaining for phosphorylated alpha-synuclein (pS129 $\\alpha$-syn), as well as vascular organization (CD31 and GLUT1), was performed after MRI scan. Results In vivo SVOT imaging revealed a lower $\\mathrm{sO}_{2}{ }^{\\text {SVOT }}$ in the spinal cord of M83 mice compared to non-transgenic littermates at sub- $100 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$ spatial resolution. Ex vivo MRI-assisted by in-house developed deep learning-based automatic segmentation (validated by manual analysis) revealed no volumetric atrophy in the spinal cord of M83 mice compared to non-transgenic littermates at $50 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$ spatial resolution. The vascular network was not impaired in the spinal cord of M83 mice in the presence of pS129 $\\alpha$-syn accumulation. Conclusion We developed tools for deep-learning-based analysis for the segmentation of mouse spinal cord structural MRI data, and volumetric analysis of $\\mathrm{sO}_{2}{ }^{\\text {SVOT }}$ data. We demonstrated non-invasive high-resolution imaging of reduced $\\mathrm{sO}_{2}{ }^{\\text {SVOT }}$ in the absence of volumetric structural changes in the spinal cord of PD M83 mouse model.\n\n\nKeywords Alpha-synuclein $\\cdot$ Deep learning $\\cdot$ Magnetic resonance imaging $\\cdot$ Optoacoustic imaging $\\cdot$ Oxygen saturation $\\cdot$ Parkinson's disease $\\cdot$ Spinal cord\n\n| Abbreviations |  | CSA | Cross-sectional area |\n| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |\n| $\\alpha$-syn | Alpha-synuclein | DAPI | 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole |\n| ANOVA | Analysis of variance | GFAP | Glial fibrillary acidic protein |\n| BAT | Brown adipose tissue | GLUT1 | Glucose transporter 1 |\n| CD31 | Cluster of differentiation 31 | GM | Gray matter |\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    Benjamin F.

PD is clinically characterized by bradykinesia, rigidity, and resting tremor [1], which is pathologically characterized by the accumulation of Lewy bodies composed of insoluble alpha-synuclein ( $\\alpha$-syn) fibrils. Emerging evidence shows a close relationship between a reduction in the oxygen supply, $\\alpha$-syn pathology, and PD development [2, 3]. Oxygen intake and utilization disorders, such as cerebral hypoperfusion [4] and hypoxia in the brain, have been implicated in the pathogenesis of PD $[2,5]$. Risk genes for PD, such as leucine-rich-repeat kinase 2, PINK1, and PRKN [6], are often associated with mitochondrial dysfunction and impaired cellular respiration. In addition, environmental risk factors associated with PD, including air pollution, pesticide, and heavy metal exposure, are directly linked to oxygen uptake and utilization disorders by modulating ventilation, competing for haemoglobin binding, or affecting the mitochondrial electron transport chain [7-9]. Cerebrovascular risk factors such as prior stroke, hypertension, coronary heart disease, or congestive heart failure are also associated with PD, and targeting them is currently considered a promising approach to slow pathology [10, 11]. According to the Braak staging of PD based on the spreading of alpha-synuclein ( $\\alpha$-syn) pathology, the spinal cord is affected early in the disease process (stage 2) prior to the nigrostriatal pathway (stage 3) and limbic system (stage 4) in the brain [12, 13]. This is also associated with functional connectivity changes [14-16], which may contribute to clinical non-motor and motor symptoms commonly developing in PD patients, including pain, constipation, and poor balance [17], indicating its importance in disease progression.\n\nRecent in vitro studies have shown that hypoxic stressinduced leads to abnormal accumulation of the phosphorylated alpha-synuclein at the position Ser129 (pS129 $\\alpha$-syn) and $\\alpha$-syn oligomers, as well as degeneration of dopaminergic neurons [18, 19]. Transient focal ischemia has also been shown to upregulate pS129 $\\alpha$-syn in a stroke mouse model [20]. In humans, studies have shown increased plasma levels of total $\\alpha$-syn and pS129 $\\alpha$-syn in patients suffering from chronic intermittent hypoxia or obstructive sleep apnea [21], which are predisposing factors for PD development. Further exploration of hypoxia signaling mechanisms in $\\alpha$-syn pathology and neurodegeneration will facilitate a better understanding of PD pathogenesis and allow for the exploration of new therapeutic strategies.\n\nA number of imaging modalities, such as perfusion and functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) [22-24], two-photon phosphorescence lifetime microscopy [25, 26], positron emission tomography [27], contrast-enhanced [28] and ultrasound (US) localization microscopy [29], have previously been employed for imaging functional alterations in the spinal cord of rodent models. Optoacoustic imaging has previously been employed to study hemodynamic alterations in neurodegenerative diseases [30] and stroke [3133], as well as other proteinopathies using extrinsic contrast agents $[34,35]$. This method has also been used to detect changes in the spinal cord of an ischemic stroke mouse model [36,37], as well as in an experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis model of multiple sclerosis [38]. Spiral volumetric optoacoustic tomography (SVOT) represents a state-of-the-art approach for whole-body preclinical volumetric 3D imaging with scalable spatio-temporal resolution [39] with nearly isotropic resolution and rich spectroscopic optical contrast, making it highly suitable for accurate signal quantification and direct oxygenation measurements in the mouse body spinal cord.\n\nThe current study aims to develop tools to assess potential oxygenation changes and volumetric reduction in the spinal cord of $\\alpha$-synucleinopathy mouse model [39, 40]. We used the M83 PD mouse model (hetero- and homozygous), which overexpresses the mutated A53T $\\alpha$-syn form, 9-12 months of age) [41]. We assessed spinal oxygenation by mapping in vivo with SVOT (at sub-100 $\\mu \\mathrm{m}$ spatial resolution) [42, 43], and analyzed the $\\mathrm{sO}_{2}{ }^{\\text {SVOT }}$ using in-house developed processing and volumetric analysis script. This was followed by ex vivo T1-weighted (T1w) MRI (at $50 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$ spatial resolution) and in-house developed deep learningbased gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM) segmentation quantification, as well as immunofluorescence staining for validation ex vivo."

FB: fiber bundle, DAQ: data acquisition system, OA: optoacoustic. (B)\n\n## Methods\n\n## Animal model\n\nIn total, 22 M83 mice ( 14 homozygous and 8 heterozygous) between 9 and 12 months of age overexpressing the A53Tmutated human alpha-synuclein gene SNCA gene under the mouse prion promoter (C57BI/C3H background) [37, 41] and 13 age-matched non-transgenic littermates (NTLs) of both sexes (M83 10/12 males/females and NTLs 6/7 males/ females) were used throughout the study. Heterozygous and homozygous M83 mice develop motor impairment at 22-28 and $8-16$ months of age, respectively [37, 41]. The brain histopathology and development of behavioral abnormalities have been well characterized in the transgenic M83 PD mouse model [41]. Motor symptoms are thought to be an outcome of pyramidal or motor neurodegeneration rather than the result of nigrostriatal degeneration in this model [44] and $\\alpha$-syn inclusions are found primarily in the spinal cord and the brain stem. Four M83 (2/2 males/females) and three NTLs ( $0 / 3$ males/females) were scanned using the in vivo SVOT system, 15 M83 (9/6) and 7 NTLs (2/5) were imaged ex vivo with MRI, and 9 M83 (3/6 males/females) and 6 NTLs ( $4 / 2$ males/females) were included in the histological analysis.

Pelleted food (3437PXL15, Cargill) and water were provided ad libitum. All the experiments were performed in accordance with the Swiss Federal Act on Animal Protection and were approved by the Cantonal Veterinary Office Zurich (ZH024/2021). In accordance with the animal license and animal housing facility requirements, we monitored the well-being and checked weekly for whether there was presence of paralysis in the mice, as well as before the imaging experiment. None of the animals displayed paralysis of the limbs, which is consistent with previously reported observations in M83 mice at this age [41].\n\n## Spiral volumetric optoacoustic tomography\n\nThe SVOT system employs a Nd: YAG-pumped optical parametric oscillator laser (SpitLight, Innolas Laser GmbH, Krailling, Germany) as an excitation light source. It delivers $<10 \\mathrm{~ns}$ duration pulses at a repetition rate of 10 Hz over a broad tunable wavelength range ( $680-1250 \\mathrm{~nm}$ ) with per-pulse energies up to $\\sim 180 \\mathrm{~mJ}$. Five wavelengths ( 700 , $730,760,800$ and 850 nm ) were employed repeatedly in succession ( 20 averages per wavelength) to efficiently unmix the oxygenated haemoglobin $\\left(\\mathrm{HbO}_{2}\\right)$, deoxygenated"

The whole period including imaging preparation and image acquisition lasted for 50 min for all the mice (under $1.5 \\%$ isoflurane). Inhalation anesthesia was delivered in a closed system with a thin transparent membrane covering the nose and mouth of the animal, allowing it to breathe normally [33, 39, 40]. The mice were fixed on the animal holder and the preparation took approximately 10 min . The mice were given another 10 min to stabilize before imaging acquisition.

Next, a GPU-implemented backprojection reconstruction technique was employed for the reconstruction of individual volumetric frames, with each US sensing element split into 16 subelements [39, 40]. Whole-spinal cord images were obtained by stitching individual reconstructed volumes at each corresponding position of the spherical array.

To quantify the $\\mathrm{sO}_{2}{ }^{\\text {SVOT }}$ in the spinal cord volumetrically, we further developed code and volumetric analysis pipeline for the reconstruction and processing of the imaging data. In our earlier SVOT studies, the optoacoustic signals were not yet quantified in 3D [39, 40]. All the image reconstruction and processing steps were performed in MATLAB (MathWorks, USA).

The coil system operated at 30 K for reception in combination with a circularly polarized 86 mm volume resonator for transmission [50].

By using an anatomical atlas [47] for guidance, representative axial T1w image sections matching the 23 spinal segments from the thoracic, lumbar and sacral parts (T1-T13, L1-L6 and S1-S4) were identified. GM and WM in the spinal cord were automatically segmented using an in-house developed deep learning-based model trained on manually annotated slices and improved by active learning [52]. The model, which is based on a 3D nnUNet architecture [53], takes as input a 3D MR image and outputs a 3D segmentation file with values of 1 for GM, 2 for WM and 0 for background. The GM and WM cross-sectional areas (CSAs) were then extracted using the sct_process_segmentation command from the Spinal Cord Toolbox [54] (v6.1). Validation of the deep learning method was performed by comparing the automatically computed CSAs (without angle correction) with the manually segmented CSAs from the same 13 thoracic sections (T1-T13) for one mouse. To study the potential volumetric changes, the average of five CSAs from 5 consecutive sections was calculated per segment for all 23 identified segments (thoracic, lumbar and sacral) and per mouse. GM and WM CSAs as well as WM/GM ratios were further analyzed.\n\n## Immunofluorescence and immunohistochemical staining\n\nMouse brain and spinal cord samples were extracted and placed in 0.1 M PBS for 24 h in $15 \\%$ sucrose and in $30 \\%$ sucrose in 0.1 M PBS until the tissue sank or for a maximum of 5 days.

Automatic quantification of the colocalization of the pS129-positive pixel with the DAPI-positive pixel was performed with ImageJ (Fiji, NIH ) to quantify its presence in the vicinity of the nucleus. To study the relative nuclear fraction of pS129 $\\alpha$-syn, the pS129-positive signal colocalized with DAPI was divided by the DAPI-positive area. This fraction was named the \"relative nuclear pS129-positive signal area\". The remaining fraction of the pS129-positive signal was divided by the total area of the image subtracted by the DAPI area to analyze the fraction occupied by this signal in the cytoplasmic compartment (\"relative cytoplasmic pS129-positive signal area\"). Representative images of CD31, GLUT1 and pS129 $\\alpha$-syn staining of the spinal cord sections were taken using Zeiss Axio Scan Z1 slide scanner (Carl Zeiss Meditec AG, Germany) at $20 \\times$ magnification and a TCS SP8 confocal laser scanning microscope at $63 \\times$ magnification. Representative images of GFAP and NeuN staining were taken using TCS SP8 confocal laser scanning microscope at $10 \\times$ and $20 \\times$ magnification. Representative images of Iba1 staining were taken using Zeiss Axio Scan Z1 slide scanner at $20 \\times$ magnification.\n\n## Statistical analysis\n\nAll the statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 9.5.0 (GraphPad Software, Inc., USA). Data distributions were first tested for normality by visually assessing the histograms and the Shapiro-Wilk test. For distributed data (Figs. 3 and 5), groups were compared using two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Holm-Sidak's multiple comparisons post hoc analysis. Unpaired MannWhitney tests and Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank tests followed by Holm-Sidak's multiple comparison post hoc analyses were performed for the data shown in Fig. 6B and Supplemental Fig. 4 respectively, as the data were not normally distributed. Nonparametric Spearman's rank analysis was performed for analyzing the correlation between readouts. Violin plots display all the dots, quartiles and medians, and bar plots present the mean $\\pm$ standard deviation. Significance was set at $p<0.05$.\n\n## Results\n\n## Reduction in $\\mathrm{SO}_{2}{ }^{S V O T}$ in the spinal cord of M83 mice\n\nWe first assessed in vivo whether alterations in $\\mathrm{sO}_{2}{ }^{\\text {SVOT }}$ levels occurred in the spinal cord of M83 mice and NTLs at $9-12$ months of age (Fig. 1A). SVOT imaging was performed with a spherical matrix array transducer scanned\nalong the animal's back from neck-to-tail in a step-and-go scanning manner. At each position of the spherical array, multispectral optoacoustic data were spectrally unmixed to differentiate $\\mathrm{HbO}_{2}$ (Fig. 2A) and HbR (Fig. 2B) contents along the spinal cord [39], followed by calculation of the $\\mathrm{sO}_{2}{ }^{\\text {SVOT }}$ (Fig. 2C). To visualize the differences in the $\\mathrm{sO}_{2}{ }^{\\text {SVOT }}$ across the spinal cord segments, ex vivo structural T1w scans were acquired to use landmarks for segmentation (Figs. 1B and 3A). $\\mathrm{sO}_{2}{ }^{\\text {SVOT }}$ sagittal maximum intensity projections were segmented into thoracic, lumbar, and sacral ROIs (Fig. 3B and C), and the mean $\\mathrm{sO}_{2}{ }^{\\text {SVOT }}$ was computed (Fig. 3D). The cervical part of the spinal cord could not be assessed as too little optoacoustic signal was measured. This may be due to the brown adipose tissue (BAT) covering this region, which is strongly absorbing based on its high metabolic activity [58], preventing the light from reaching the spinal cord underneath. Compared with age-matched NTL mice, M83 mice presented significant reductions in the $\\mathrm{sO}_{2}{ }^{\\text {SVOT }}$ in the thoracic (by $15 \\%, p=0.0013$ ), lumbar (by $13 \\%, p=0.0015$ ), and sacral regions (by $16 \\%, p=0.0005$ ) as well as the total spinal cord (by $14 \\%, p=0.0014$ ) (Fig. 3D). These findings suggested a reduction in the $\\mathrm{sO}_{2}{ }^{\\text {SVOT }}$ level in the spinal cord of M83 mice.\n\n## Low $\\mathrm{SO}_{2}{ }^{\\text {SVOT }}$ in the spinal cord is not associated with spinal volumetric reduction\n\nNext, we developed an automatic segmentation generated by a deep learning model to quantify the potential spinal volumetric changes associated with low spinal $\\mathrm{sO}_{2}^{\\text {SVOT }}$ (code and imaging datasets are available). To validate the automatic segmentation generated by the deep learning model, we first compared the CSA values of the GM and WM of the model outputs (Fig. 4B) with those of the manually segmented CSAs (Fig. 4A) in the same sections. Spearman's correlation analysis revealed a very strong positive linear relationship between the deep learning method and manual segmentation $(n=26, r=0.9596, p<0.0001)$ (Fig. 4C). These findings indicate that the deep learning model, which is used to generate GM and WM CSAs, is an efficient and reliable tool for quantifying potential structural spinal changes in mice.\n\nQuantification using CSAs indicated that there was no volumetric alteration in the spinal cord GM or WM between M83 mice and their NTLs in any of the thoracic, lumbar, or sacral segments of the spinal cord or in the ratio of GM/WM (Fig. 4D). NeuN staining revealed an intact Clark's column in the thoracic and lumbar spinal segments of M83 mice, although the number of motor neurons appeared to be relatively low (Supplemental Fig. 1A and B). We further examined whether there was atrophy in the brain of M83 mice using 9.4T MRI ex vivo. No structural abnormalities or"

Next, we performed staining for astrocytes (GFAP) and microglia (Iba1) in the different spinal segments of M83 mice. No apparent astrocytosis or microgliosis was observed throughout the spinal cord of M83 mice. Both astrocytes and microglia displayed homeostatic non-reactive morphology in the sections examined (Supplemental Fig. 1A and B and Supplemental Fig. 3A and B).\n\n## Reduced $\\mathrm{sO}_{2}{ }^{S V O T}$ in the spinal cord is not due to impaired vascular organization\n\nTo explore the cause of the reduction in $\\mathrm{sO}_{2}{ }^{S V O T}$ in the spinal cord of M83 mice, we analyzed spinal vascular organization after in vivo imaging (Fig. 1C). We first performed immunostaining of the thoracic, lumbar, and sacral regions using the platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule (CD31), which is expressed by differentiated endothelial cells (Fig. 5A) [51]. To assess the vasculature network, we used an ImageJ (Fiji) script to automatically calculate (1) the area fraction of blood vessels, (2) the length of blood vessels and, (3) the number of branches and junctions [57] based on the CD31 staining. No significant differences were detected in the vasculature area $(p=0.1586, p=0.1827$, and $p=0.1314)$, the number of branches ( $p=0.3300, p=0.3300$, and $p=0.3127$ ), or the vascular length ( $p=0.2262, p=0.1335$, and $p=0.2001$ ) in the thoracic, lumbar, and sacral segments between M83 and NTL control mice (Fig. 5B, C and D).\n\nWe then performed glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) immunostaining to study the functionality of the vessel in the spinal cord. The GLUT1 protein is critical for transporting glucose across the blood-brain barrier to the central nervous system and is highly expressed by endothelial cells [62]. The GLUT1-positive area fraction was not significantly different between M83 and NTL mice in any of the three spinal segments ( $p=0.2559, p=0.2559$, and $p=0.3998$, respectively, in the thoracic, lumbar and, sacral segments) (Fig. 5E). These results suggest that M83 mice do not exhibit vascular network disruption in the spinal cord.\n\n## Alpha-synuclein deposits throughout the spinal cord in M83 mice\n\nNext, we assessed the distribution of $\\alpha$-syn pathology in the spinal cord sections of M83 and NTL mice using anti-pS129 $\\alpha$-syn antibodies. $\\alpha$-Syn undergoes posttranslational modifications, particularly phosphorylation at the Ser129 site [12,\n13]. Given the complex findings reported in $\\alpha$-syn staining using different antibodies, we used three widely used antibodies against pS129 $\\alpha$-syn, i.e., the EP1536Y, 81A, and MJR-R13 clones. The pS129 $\\alpha$-syn signal (EP1536Y clone) was more abundant at the level of the thoracic ( $1.227 \\%$ vs. $0.006 \\%, p=0.001198$ ), lumbar ( $1.100 \\%$ vs. $0.010 \\%$, $p=0.001198$ ) and sacral ( $1.192 \\%$ vs. $0.008 \\%, p=0.002525$ ) spinal segments in M83 mice compared to NTLs, mainly in the GM and in the vicinity of the nuclei (Fig. 6A and B and Supplemental Fig. 4). Notably, a similar pS129 $\\alpha$-synpositive signal was also detected in the brain, mainly in the cortex of M83 mice (Supplemental Fig. 2B). In contrast, the other two anti-pS129 $\\alpha$-syn antibodies, the 81 A clone and, MJR-R13 clones presented reduced sensitivity, indicating differences in the signal intensity and localization of pS129$\\alpha$-syn throughout the spinal cord of M83 mice in comparison to NTLs (Supplemental Fig. 5). Similar results in the spinal $\\mathrm{sO}_{2}{ }^{\\text {SVOT }}$, spinal volume and pS129 $\\alpha$-syn load were observed in M83 hetero- and homozygous mice.\n\n## Discussion\n\nIn this work, we demonstrated the utility of SVOT in measuring reduced $\\mathrm{sO}_{2}{ }^{\\text {SVOT }}$ in the spinal cord of the M83 mouse model of $\\alpha$-synucleinopathy with sub-100-micron spatial resolution and unimpaired GM/WM structures by ex vivo T1w MRI, whereas ex vivo histological experiments revealed no vascular network dysfunction but greater pS129 $\\alpha$-syn accumulation in the spinal cord of M83 mice compared to NTL mice. To our knowledge, this work is the first to employ optoacoustic imaging and MRI for the spinal cord imaging in PD mouse model.\n\nThere are two data analysis tools developed and optimized in the current study, including (1) in-house deep learning-based model, based on a 3D nnUNet architecture, for automatic segmentation and quantification of mouse spinal T1w MR data for GM/WM volumetric analysis. Deep learning-based model trained on manually annotated slices and improved by active learning [52]. Tools for segmentation of human spinal cord was available in Spinal Cord Toolbox [54](v6.1), but not for mouse/rat spinal cord with different geometry, angles etc. We further validated the deep-learning analysis method with manual segmentation on another dataset. This open-source tool will be useful in future studies on mouse spinal cord structural MRI quantification. (2) an in-house pipeline to quantify the $\\mathrm{sO}_{2}{ }^{\\text {SVOT }}$ signal volumetrically in the spinal cord. We have previously quantified the oxygenation imaging in 2D using SVOT $\\left(\\mathrm{sO}_{2}{ }^{\\text {SVOT }}\\right)$ in tumor of animal model with isoflurane anesthesia [33]. Thus far there is only one study using optoacoustics for in vivo measurement in the mouse spinal cord, of which the imaging"

Therefore the present study is the first for 3D imaging and quantification of oxygenation in mouse spinal cord, and in PD animal model in particular.\n\nBy using in vivo SVOT, we showed a $13-16 \\%$ reduction in the $\\mathrm{sO}_{2}{ }^{\\text {SVOT }}$ level in the spinal cord of M83 mice compared with NTLs (under $1.5 \\%$ inhalation isoflurane). Indeed, many studies have used optoacoustic/photoacoustic assessment of oxygenation with isoflurane anesthesia in the brain and trunk of mice. Isoflurane has varying effects on the hemoglobin oxygen dissociation curve in human blood samples at different doses [63]. Complicated factors may influence $\\mathrm{sO}_{2}$ quantification, such as spectral coloring (wavelength-dependent attenuation) [64, 65], which can be partially compensated for by correcting for light attenuation with depth [66]. The measured $\\mathrm{sO}_{2}{ }^{\\text {SVOT }}$ might differ from the absolute value of oxygen saturation. Therefore, we used $\\mathrm{sO}_{2}{ }^{\\text {SVOT }}$ to represent a surrogate parameter for estimating relative changes in oxygen saturation. In addition, the time-to-anesthesia and the accumulated doses of isoflurane during the induction period differed among different mice. Our recording of time was not precise enough for calculating the accumulated isoflurane. Further studies are needed to investigate the effects of induction or accumulated doses of isoflurane on the in vivo measurement of $\\mathrm{sO}_{2}$.\n\nReduced $\\left[{ }^{18} \\mathrm{~F}\\right]$ fluorodeoxyglucose uptake in the spinal cord has been observed in M83 mice at 9 months of age [27]. The low $\\mathrm{sO}_{2}{ }^{\\text {SVOT }}$ found was in line with previous studies on cerebral $\\alpha$-syn-associated mitochondrial degeneration in this model when treated with the pesticide paraquat, which is absent in the wild-type human $\\alpha$-syn M7 line [67]. In contrast, the administration of the iron chelator clioquinol, a compound that stabilizes functional hypoxia-inducible factor- $1 \\alpha$, improved motor function in M83 mice [68]. The presence of solid bones and other acoustically mismatched tissues, such as the lungs, can lead to ultrasound aberrations, resulting in artifacts in optoacoustic imaging (e.g., the effects of large air-filled cavities [69]). The typical diameter of the spinal cord in mice is $2-3 \\mathrm{~mm}$ [70], and the largest thickness of the vertebrae is approximately $200 \\mu \\mathrm{~m}$. This is relatively thin compared with the acoustic wavelength for the central frequency of the array employed $(215 \\mu \\mathrm{~m})$. Therefore, the effects of acoustic aberrations are relatively small. In addition, in contrast to ultrasound imaging, the propagation of ultrasound waves in optoacoustic imaging is unidirectional, and consequently, aberrations are lower. Indeed, while we acknowledge that some distortion is produced by the vertebra in the spinal cord, several groups have reported full-body optoacoustic images of mice using transducers with frequencies of approximately $5-10 \\mathrm{MHz}$, where the murine spinal cord could be accurately resolved by assuming a constant speed of sound [71-73]. The impact\nof mouse vertebrae on spectral unmixing does not result in significant changes in the propagation of light relative to that in other tissues. Potential acoustic distortions are the same for optoacoustic images at different wavelengths and hence have a limited impact on spectral unmixing. Indeed, we have shown that $\\mathrm{sO}_{2}$ estimation is still possible through the human skull, which can induce strong acoustic aberrations [74]. The use of longer wavelengths (lower ultrasound frequencies) can reduce the aberrations associated with ultrasound propagation through a larger spinal cord. This, however, comes to the detriment of the achievable spatial resolution. We anticipate that an eventual clinical application of photoacoustics to image the spine would be based on relatively low frequencies of approximately 1 MHz (resolution around 1 mm ) to avoid ultrasound aberrations, similar to transcranial clinical ultrasound applications. It is noted that the SVOT system was specifically designed to image mice/rats, and a different optoacoustic embodiment would be needed for clinical application in humans.\n\nWhile functional and structural MRI has been performed on the spinal cord in wild-type [75, 76], tau [48], and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [77, 78] mice. Very few in vivo or ex vivo MRI or optical studies have been performed in PD animal models [79, 80]. Our deep learning-based MRI assessment and NeuN staining did not reveal structural atrophy or apparent neuronal loss in the spinal cord of M83 mice compared with their NTLs. Low tissue oxygenation is known to contribute to neurodegeneration by reducing the energy supply to neurons in humans [81, 82]. Ealier studies showed that chronic cerebral hypoperfusion led to brain WM lesions [83] and neuronal functional deficits were associated with spinal cord hypoxia in an experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis model [84]. Previous studies have shown that spinal axonal degeneration leads to myelin deterioration in 12-month-old M83 mice [41] and impaired neurons are found in the spinal cord of rodent models of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine- or rotenoneinduced experimental parkinsonism by immunostaining [85-87]. One possibility is that M83 mice exhibit oxygen saturation impairments in the spinal cord before presenting strong markers of neurodegeneration. In addition, ex vivo MRI might not be sensitive enough to detect axonal degeneration in the spinal cord of M83 mice at this age.\n\nTo understand the possible reasons for the observed reduction in $\\mathrm{sO}_{2}{ }^{\\text {SVOT }}$ in M83 compared with NTLs, we investigated alterations in the vasculature, glial activation, and $\\alpha$-syn levels. Our ex vivo analysis of spinal vascular organization and functionality suggested that the reduction in $\\mathrm{sO}_{2}{ }^{\\text {SVOT }}$ was not associated with vascular network impairment, as CD31 and GLUT1 expression did not significantly differ between the two strains. Hemodynamic changes are also possible under intact vascular structures via various"

In addition, the use of isoflurane has previously been shown to reduce the cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen and prevent hypoxia during cortical spreading depolarization in vitro [89]. An earlier study showed that isoflurane was able to modify the affinity between haemoglobin and oxygen by shifting the oxygen dissociation curve in human blood samples [63]. We did not measure the isoflurane concentration in the blood (e.g., through multiple gas chromatography-mass spectrometry measurements), which could provide the ultimate quantification, owing to the limited amount of mouse blood and the complexity of the measurement. To minimize potential confounding effects due to anesthetics: We will focus on the following aspects: (1) awake mouse imaging: in vivo photoacoustic microscopy for hemodynamic and oxygen-metabolic responses has been demonstrated in the brain of awake mice in earlier studies [90]. However, this has not yet been implemented in our current imaging system for the mouse spinal cord. (2) standardized duration of anesthesia induction to reduce variability in the accumulated dose of anesthetics.3) Usage and comparison of alternative anesthetics with inhaled isoflurane anesthesia udsed in the current study. (3) minimizing dosage: Using the lowest effective dose of anesthesia will reduce physiological alterations while maintaining adequate immobilization. (4) continuous monitoring: By using a pulse oximeter to monitor oxygen saturation, blood pressure, and heart rate during anesthesia and imaging. This may help to detect any deviations caused by the anesthetic.\n\nNeuroinflammation is closely linked to cerebral energy metabolism impairments in neurodegenerative diseases. Recently, the induction of neuroinflammation in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease was shown to elicit reductions in cerebral intravascular oxygen and increases in oxygen extraction in the brain [84, 91]. Neuroinflammatory pathology in an experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis mouse model led to hypoxia accompanied by a reduction in spinal vascular perfusion [38]. In this study, we did not observe any signs of inflammation in the spinal cord of M83 mice, as astrocytes and microglia did not display reactive phenotypes. This finding is in line with an earlier study showing gliosis only in M83 and M83 mice injected with $\\alpha$-syn preformed fibrils [92].\npS129 $\\alpha$-syn is one of the most robust pathological markers of early $\\alpha$-syn aggregation, with almost all the aggregates containing this posttranslational modification [12, 13]. The accumulation of pS129 $\\alpha$-syn has also been observed in the context of oxygen intake and utilization disorders in cells, as well as in middle cerebral artery occlusion rodent models [20, 93], and in patients with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome [94]. Our study revealed an increase in the pS129\n$\\alpha$-syn-positive (clone EP1536Y) signal within the spinal cord of M83 mice compared with their NTLs, where immunofluorescence staining revealed that the main location of $\\mathrm{pS} 129 \\alpha$-syn was in the vicinity of the nucleus. Numerous antibodies targeting this posttranslational modification of $\\alpha$-syn have been developed with off-target effects, as well as non-specific binding and disparity in staining signals using these antibodies, as reported earlier [95-97]. It is noted that $\\alpha$-syn staining appeared to be an antibody (clonedependent) in the spinal cord of M83 mice, with negative staining observed using two other clones targeting pS129 $\\alpha$-syn (81A and MJR-R13), which were positive for clone EP1536Y (which is robust and widely used) [95]. The difference in the pS129-positive signal observed and quantified between M83 mice and NTLs was genotype dependent in our study and was useful for studying early pathological changes in this model of PD. Further mechanistic studies on the potential association between low oxygen saturation and pS129 $\\alpha$-syn accumulation will be informative.\n\nThere are several limitations in the present study: (1) unmatched in vivo and ex vivo sample sizes and sex imbalance in the samples (mice with pigments on the skin inside the region of interest after shaving were excluded from the in vivo study and were only used for ex vivo analysis), also leading to small animal groups for in vivo SVOT; (2) Although the amount of inhaled isoflurane, concentration and flow rate during the imaging session were the same for all the mice, there was a variation in the time-to-anesthesia when the mice were under the anaesthesia induction. Therefore the accumulated dose of inhaled isoflurane in each mouse was not quantified and not compared between two groups, so a compounding effect of isoflurane on reduction of $\\mathrm{sO}_{2}$ could not be excluded. Other factors such as partial pressure of oxygen, partial pressure of carbon dioxide, and pH also influence the $\\mathrm{sO}_{2}$ [98], but were not measured in the current study. (3) The cervical part of the spine region displayed very little or no signal and thus could not be measured owing to the strong absorption of the BAT. (4) For logistic reasons, MRI was performed ex vivo. Since the goal of this imaging/observational study was to evaluate potential structural and oxygenation alterations in the spinal cord of a transgenic mouse model of PD, the mechanism for the observed reduction in the spinal oxygen concentration in M83 PD mice has not been clearly elucidated. Future studies are needed to address the underlying causes of the reduction in spinal oxygenation saturation and potential links between $\\alpha$-syn and oxygenation saturation in the spinal cord of M83 mice."
