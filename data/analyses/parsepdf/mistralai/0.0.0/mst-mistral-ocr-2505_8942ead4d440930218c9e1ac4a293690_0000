To offer individualised medicine approaches, we need to better target interventions by stratifying autistic people into subgroups with different biological profiles and/or prognoses. We sought to validate neural responses to faces as a potential stratification biomarker in ASD by measuring neural (electroencephalography/EEG) responses to faces (critical in social interaction) in N=436 children and adults with and without ASD. The speed of early-stage face processing (N170 latency) was on average slower in ASD than age-matched controls. In addition, N170 latency was associated with responses to faces in the fusiform gyrus during an fMRI task and polygenic scores for ASD, triangulating links to social biology. Critically, within the ASD group N170 latency predicted change in adaptive socialisation skills over an 18-month follow-up period; data-driven clustering identified a subgroup with slower brain responses and poor social prognosis. Use of a distributional data-driven cut-off was associated with predicted improvements of power in simulated clinical trials targeting social functioning. Taken together, this provides converging evidence for the utility of the N170 as a stratification biomarker to identify biologically and prognostically defined subgroups in ASD, and may provide a blueprint for similar endeavours in other psychiatric conditions.\n\nOne sentence summary: N170 latency to faces relates to fusiform activity and ASD genetics, predicts social prognosis, and could improve power in clinical trials."

      "markdown": "# 2. Introduction \n\nAutism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental condition associated with difficulties in social interaction and communication and the presence of restricted or repetitive behaviors or interests and sensory sensitivities ${ }^{1}$. The causes of ASD are highly heterogenous, with multiple identified genetic factors ${ }^{2}$ and several possible environmental factors that likely interact with genetic background ${ }^{3}$. Symptom presentation is also highly variable, both in core symptomatology but also the presence or absence of a range of associated conditions like anxiety, depression, intellectual disability or language delay ${ }^{4}$. To move towards individualised interventions/support strategies, we need to stratify this heterogeneous population into more biologically and prognostically homogenous subgroups. This will allow particular support strategies to be better targeted to those most likely to benefit, and allow individuals with different prognoses to make better-informed decisions about intervention choices. To do this, it may be fruitful to focus separately on the social and non-social domains, given substantial evidence that they are both genetically ${ }^{5}$ and phenotypically ${ }^{6}$ separable.\n\nDifficulties in engaging with the social world are central to the symptom profile of ASD. Social difficulties in ASD can compromise everyday adaptive functioning ${ }^{7}$ and social withdrawal and associated loneliness are major risk factors for conditions experienced at higher-than-expected rates in autistic people, including depression and anxiety ${ }^{8-10}$. Thus, developing new support strategies for social functioning is critical to boosting mental wellbeing, adaptive functioning and independence skills, and quality of life for autistic"

However, social difficulties may be associated with many different neurobiological alterations; identifying \"stratification biomarkers\" -- objective measures used to identify more biologically or prognostically homogenous subgroups -- will be crucial to developing individualised support strategies. This could improve the ethics of support strategy provision through allowing participants greater personalisation of the risk-benefit ratio of particular approaches, and should improve statistical power and generalisability of clinical trials. Despite decades of research on ASD there remain no validated stratification biomarkers ${ }^{12}$. Key steps include identifying metrics that are individually reliable, mechanistically sensitive, relevant to a known biological system, predictive of prognosis, and that have a clear potential context of use for clinical settings ${ }^{13}$.\n\nHere, we focus on the N170 neural response to faces as a candidate stratification biomarker for social functioning in $\\mathrm{ASD}^{14}$. Social interactions are complex and fast-moving, and as such expertise with faces is central to mature social interaction ${ }^{15}$. The N170 ${ }^{16}$ is a face-sensitive event-related potential of negative polarity peaking around 170 ms after stimulus onset over occipito-temporal electrodes (representing the coordinated firing of groups of neurons in simultaneously active lateral occipital areas ${ }^{17}$, including the fusiform gyrus ${ }^{18}$ ); it likely reflects face expertise ${ }^{17}$ built through experience ${ }^{192021}$ and is sensitive to configural processing measured via stimulus inversion ${ }^{22}$. Critically, its amplitude and latency have moderate to good intra-individual reliability ( $0.6-0.8{ }^{23-25}$ ). In a meta-analysis, autistic people showed on average a longer latency (slower) N170 to faces (Hedges $\\mathrm{g}=0.36$ ) but not to nonface control stimuli, relative to neurotypical controls ${ }^{26}$. Within ASD, faster N170 latency relates to better holistic face processing ${ }^{27}$; stronger adaptive socialisation ${ }^{28}$; and fewer social"

Prognostically, N170 latencies have been related to trajectories of social symptoms from childhood to adolescence ${ }^{29}$.\n\nAlthough this early work is promising, there are several shortcomings. Some investigations have not observed consistent associations between variation in the N170 and aspects of face recognition or social behavior ${ }^{25,30-34}$. Sample sizes for most studies are small ( $\\mathrm{n}<100$ ) and so power to detect relatively modest associations is low, particularly for subgrouping or stratification approaches; associations are also almost all cross-sectional and thus lack clinical and prognostic utility. Finally, there are no identified potential \"contexts of use\" (clinically useful applications) for the N170 in a clinical trial setting (such as use as an inclusion or exclusion criteria, as a surrogate endpoint, or as a baseline covariate). To move from strong preliminary evidence to validate the N170 as a stratification biomarker with clinical utility we need large and robust studies to show a) a replicable and robust signal of differences between autistic people and controls; b) that the N170 is mechanistically sensitive to alterations in expertise-based processing; c) that the N170 relates to variation in related biologically meaningful signals (e.g. derived from genetics, brain imaging); d) that the N170 correlates with a clinically-relevant behavioral measure and shows robust prognostic utility for later variation in social functioning in either all people with ASD, or a particular subgroup; and e) to define a clear context of use for the N170 within a clinical setting.\n\n# 1.1.

Our final sample size of 436 is approximately the same size as the combined (independent) sample size included in a recent meta-analysis ${ }^{26}$, and several times larger than any previous individual study. First, we examined whether differences in N170 latency relate to clinical phenotype (categorical ASD diagnostic status). Second, we examined mechanistic sensitivity by testing whether N170 latency associates with measures of expertise-sensitive processing (the magnitude of the face inversion effect in EEG ${ }^{16}$ ). Third, we tested whether N170 latency associates with ASD-relevant biological pathways by examining its association with the magnitude of brain responses to faces in core social brain areas measured through fMRI ${ }^{36}$; and to variation in ASD polygenic scores (PGS) - the aggregated effect of many common variants previously associated with ASD. Fourth, we examined prognostic utility by testing whether N170 latency predicts later social functioning within the ASD group. For this purpose we selected the Vineland-II Socialisation scale and its constituent subdomains (Play and Leisure Time, Coping Skills and Interpersonal Relationships) because a) this provides a measure of 'real world' adaptive social functioning suited to measuring the kinds of social activities that may be associated with improved quality of life and thus potentially valuable to target with support or intervention ${ }^{37}$; b) the face validity of a link between the N170 and social function and c) previous evidence of associations between the N170 and the Vineland Socialisation domain ${ }^{28,29}$.

As expected, N170 latency (N170L) to upright faces decreased with age $(F(2,430)=49.78, p<.001, \\eta_{p}{ }^{2}=0.188$; Figure S1), and was on average slower in the ASD than the control group $(F(1,430)=9.43, p=0.002, \\eta_{p}{ }^{2}=0.021$; Figure 1). N170L did not differ across hemispheres $(F(1,430)=.68, p=0.41, \\eta_{p}{ }^{2}=0.002)$ and diagnosis, age and hemisphere did not interact (all $F s<1.7$, all $p s>0.2, \\eta_{p}{ }^{2} s<0.004$ ).\n\nAdding site and sex and their interactions with diagnostic group did not alter the statistical pattern (main effect of group on latency ( $\\mathrm{F}(1,426)=7.03, \\mathrm{p}=0.02, \\eta_{\\mathrm{p}}{ }^{2}=0.013$ ); diagnostic group effects did not significantly vary by site $(\\mathrm{F}(1,426)=1.36, \\mathrm{p}=0.25, \\eta_{\\mathrm{p}}{ }^{2}=0.003$ ), or sex $(\\mathrm{F}(1,426)=0.16, \\mathrm{p}=0.69, \\eta_{\\mathrm{p}}{ }^{2}=0.000)$ and sex had no overall effect on N170L ( $\\mathrm{F}(1,426)=.07, \\mathrm{p}$ $=0.80, \\eta_{\\mathrm{p}}{ }^{2}<0.001$ ).

Within this sample 198 ASD and 133 controls had EEG data. For the ASD PGS and a range of other comparisons (see SM Table S5), the genome wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics were used as a reference (all with an additive model). Results showed that longer N170 latency associated with higher PGS for ASD (Figure 3); Spearman's $r 2=0.026 ; p=0.0031$; participants with ASD $r 2=0.022 ; p=0.039$; controls $r 2=0.024 ; p=0.074$ ) but not comparison traits such as schizophrenia, brain volume, intelligence or body mass index (Figure S5). Of note, the correlation between N170L and ASD-PGS remains significant when the latter was computed with the new SBayesR method ${ }^{43}(\\mathrm{p}=0.035)$. Interestingly, there was also a significant positive correlation with the PGS for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) ${ }^{44}$ $(r 2=0.01 ; p=0.039)$ and a negative correlation with a recent PGS computed for scores on the \"Reading the Mind in the Eyes\" test ${ }^{45}(r 2=0.01 ; p=0.03)$, a measure of cognitive empathy that can be more challenging for autistic participants ${ }^{46}$.\n\n### 2.5.

Specifically, this would mean that individuals with a relatively longer N170 latency could be enrolled in a trial because they would be (probabilistically) less likely to show spontaneous improvement in their social adaptive functioning over time than those with a shorter N170. First, we show sensitivity to clinical phenotype: that as a group, individuals with ASD show slower N170 responses to upright faces, replicating a recent meta-analysis ${ }^{26}$. This effect does not vary with age, sex, attention, collection site or medication and was not confounded by IQ or associated conditions such as ADHD or anxiety. Second, variation in N170 latency associates with a marker of configural processing (the face inversion effect). Third, we show relation to other biological variables: variation in N170 latency across the cohort was associated with higher polygenic liability for ASD and with the fMRI response of a core brain region involved in face processing, the fusiform gyrus ${ }^{47}$. Fourth, we demonstrate potential prognostic utility. Variation in N170 latency associates with social clinical prognosis (change in Vineland Socialisation Play and Leisure Time scores, a subdomain that at follow-up associated with overall global impressions of change between baseline and follow-up and concurrently relates to key measures of quality of life) over an 18-month period in both dimensional and subtype analysis. Finally, we further define a potential context of use: we show that data-derived cut-off scores could provide substantial efficiencies in clinical trials, reducing the magnitude of potential placebo effects. Taken together, we contend that the N170 meets core criteria for consideration as a stratification biomarker for ASD."

Case/control differences \n\nOur work replicates and extends previous demonstrations that groups of individuals with ASD show slower latency N170 responses than controls (of whom a proportion had mild intellectual disability of varied etiology) ${ }^{26}$. In our cohort, this was not confounded by associated internalising or externalising symptoms, IQ, or medication; the only baseline association was with observed social symptoms, a core aspect of the ASD phenotype. Delays in N170 latency are not specific to ASD - groups with conditions like schizophrenia also show alterations in N170 amplitude that relate to general face recognition ability ${ }^{48}$. However, schizophrenia shows substantial genetic overlap with $\\mathrm{ASD}^{49}$ and this is associated with common molecular brain-based phenotypes ${ }^{50}$. Thus, markers that carve heterogeneity within ASD are likely to operate transdiagnostically ${ }^{51}$. This observation might affect utility as (for example) a putative diagnostic biomarker (see below), but does not reduce the utility of the N170 as a potential stratification biomarker that may help us parse heterogeneity within cohorts with ASD. However, our ability to draw inferences about the degree to which the current findings regarding stratification are specific to ASD or would generalise to other conditions is limited because we did not include a control group with another developmental condition, and this will be an important step for future work.\n\nWe did not observe sex differences in N170L or in the magnitude of group differences in N170L, nor in the relation between N170L and concurrent or future measures of social behaviors.

However, the predictive relations between N170 latencies and both diagnosis and change in socialisation scores were numerically stronger and only statistically significant ( $p<0.05$ ) in males. These analyses should be considered in the light of our 3:1 sex ratio, which may have affected our ability to detect meaningful differences in the profile of autistic females and males or to detect effects within autistic females analysed separately. Future investigation in more balanced samples is warranted to establish whether biomarkers need to be sex stratified. Further, we did not measure gender identity, which may have a different influence on social processing than sex. Caution should thus be exercised when generalising our results to populations less well represented in our dataset.\n\n# 3.2. Relation to Genetics \n\nWe show that polygenic ASD scores computed from a GWAS including over 18,000 people with ASD and 27,000 controls ${ }^{53}$ correlate with variation in N170 latency. A previous twin study reported a genetic contribution to the N170 ${ }^{54}$. Our study suggests that this N170L heritability is positively correlated with the heritability of ASD (and to other psychiatric heritability since ASD is genetically correlated to other conditions). It is interesting (and somewhat expected) that the strongest observed correlation is with the ASD PGS, since individuals with ASD display replicable differences in the N170 response to faces relative to controls ${ }^{26}$. Of note, one limitation is that the proportion of variance explained by the current polygenic ASD score is relatively low (c. 2\\%) ${ }^{53}$. Clearly, there are many other processes"

Importantly, a recent study showed an association between PGS for ASD and an infant precursor of the N170 at 8-months that also relates to later diagnosis ${ }^{55}$, suggesting that effects of genes linked to ASD on the neural correlates of face processing may emerge very early in development and could play a role in causal paths to symptom emergence. Of note, the correlations between PGS-ASD and N170L we observed were present in both autistic people and controls (albeit at trend level). This may be consistent with other evidence that the genetic etiology of dimensional variation in autistic traits is similar to the etiology of autism diagnoses ${ }^{56}$ and the proposal that dimensional variation in autistic traits is underpinned by the combined effects of multiple dimensional developmental alterations ${ }^{57}$, one of which may be indexed by a longer N170L.\n\nInterestingly, N170L also associated with polygenic scores derived from a GWAS from 89,553 people who completed a measure of cognitive empathy called the \"Reading the Mind in the Eyes\" test ${ }^{45}$.

Although replication is needed before strong conclusions can be drawn, given the slowed N170L in autistic people vs controls is strongest when attention is directed to the eye region of faces ${ }^{58}$, this may point to shared neurobiological pathways via the role of eye gaze on advanced emotion recognition and early-stage face processing.

Additionally, whilst the ASD PGS score captures variance that appears relatively specific to $\\mathrm{ASD}^{49,59}$, the ADHD PGS relates to a broader range of conditions that include bipolar disorder, schizophrenia and depression ${ }^{49}$ and with age begins to explain independent aspects of both general psychopathology and condition-specific externalising behaviour ${ }^{59,60}$ The lower specificity of the ADHD PGS may be because the phenotypic definition of ADHD varies more between included cohorts (including some that are solely questionnaire based ${ }^{44}$ ) than for the ASD PGS (which requires a consensus community clinical diagnosis ${ }^{53}$ ).

Although this was a multisite study and site did not explain significant variance ( $p>0.05$ ) in prognosis or N170L, each site did not recruit sufficiently large or representative samples with prognostic data to test the generalisability of predictive models at individual sites. We must also explain why associations with this Vineland scale were solely prognostic, and not concurrent.

This would entail the use of the N170 to select a subset of a population of individuals with ASD for entry into trials targeted towards social functioning. Such 'trial enrichment' biomarkers ${ }^{75}$ are used at the discretion of those designing support strategies. In this context, perfect sensitivity and specificity to diagnostic category would not be expected. If the N170 in part reflects an index of social expertise, individuals with ASD who have a slower N170 latency may be statistically more likely to have a poorer prognosis in their social functioning and benefit more from targeted social support strategies. Our study provides evidence for prognostic value on a subdomain of the Vineland through both dimensional and categorical analysis approaches. We also show clear proof of principle that data-driven cut-offs can identify inclusion criteria that could be used to target clinical trials to those less likely to spontaneously improve, improving power and efficiency.

We then identified possible cut-points optimised for sensitivity or specificity for subsequent change in Vineland Socialisation subscale scores using bootstrapping (1000 runs) in R package cutpointr. Using an exemplar zN170L cut-off selected to have good sensitivity for detecting and excluding \"improvers\", we then used Monte Carlo simulations to determine the effect of restricting clinical trial entry to those predicted to have stable or decreasing Vineland Socialisation subscale scores over time."

A bandpass filter of $0.1 \\mathrm{~Hz}-40 \\mathrm{~Hz}$ and an FFT-based DFT notch filter at 50 Hz was applied, with 2000 ms of padding to avoid filter edge-artefacts. After filtering, data were resampled to 500 Hz .\n\n## SM1.3.2.3. Cleaning\n\nData were cleaned in Matlab using a custom-written automatic algorithm. Two classes of artefact were detected, 1) whole-scalp artefacts; and 2) EOG artefacts. Interpolation is only attempted on scalp artefacts, since EOG artefacts are largely blinks and eye movements, the presence of which suggests the participant was not watching the stimuli.\n\n1. Scalp artefacts were detected where voltages exceeded minimum/maximum criteria of $+/-100 \\mu \\mathrm{~V}$ or a range of $150 \\mu \\mathrm{~V}$. Flat channels are detected as those that do not exceed a criterion of $+/-0.0001 \\mu \\mathrm{~V}$\n2. EOG artifacts were detected on frontal electrodes FP1/z/2, AF7/8. Blink detection involved: 1) bandpass filtering the data from $3 \\mathrm{~Hz}-10 \\mathrm{~Hz}$; 2) calculating z-scores of the voltage value at each sample of each trial (relative to the distribution of samples across all trials); 3) thresholding the data with a z-score of $+/-6 \\mathrm{SDs}$; 4) detecting contiguous runs of samples greater than 50 ms in duration - these were determined to be blinks and were marked. Eye movements were detected by fitting a linear function to the data from each electrode on each trial.

In order to set age-specific search windows for peak detection we formed grand average ERPs in three-year age bins (Figure S1), and manually recorded the mean peak latency at in each bin. An algorithm then searched each individual participant average for the maximum voltage value within each age-specific time window. This was done independently for each component (P1/N170), for each condition (face upright/inverted) and at each electrode (P1: O1/2, N170: P7/8), resulting in eight separate peaks for each participant.\n\nAfter automatic peak detection, we performed a manual process of peak checking for each participant. The first rater (CE) visually inspected each peak and, where the algorithm had chosen incorrectly, manually corrected the search window. The algorithm then searched again within this window to find the correct peak. Regardless of whether any manual corrections were required, each peak was rated as: 1) OK, 2) presenting a double peak, 3) peak not clear, or 4) other (needs checking).\n\nSubsequently, two expert raters (LM \\& EJ) reviewed CE's ratings.

Further details of the fMRI procedures are available ${ }^{94,95}$.\nfMRI data analysis followed standard processing routines in SPM12 (http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/), including slice-time correction, a two-step realignment procedure, unified segmentation and normalization to standard stereotactic space as defined by the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI), and smoothing with an 8 mm full-width-at-halfmaximum Gaussian Kernel. Data were subjected to an extensive quality assessment pipeline, and datasets with excessive head motion ( $>20 \\%$ of trials with a framewise displacement greater 0.5 mm ) were excluded. For each subject, task conditions were modeled as boxcar functions that accounted for the presentation of face blocks and shape blocks, respectively. Task regressors were convolved with the canonical hemodynamic response function (HRF) and subjected as predictors to a general linear model (GLM), along with six realignment parameters to account for head motion. During first-level model estimation, data was high-pass filtered with a cut-off of 256 s , and an autoregressive model of the first order was applied.

First, we selected the neurotypical cohort from the LEAP sample (age 6 to 30 years) to build the initial model. This neurotypical cohort underwent an identical procedure to the ASD group. This allows the normative model to then be used to characterise responses within the ASD group, without any confounds from procedural differences. Second, a statistical model is estimated to model variance in a response variable (a.k.a. target or dependent variable) from a set of clinically relevant covariates (predictor or independent variables) across the reference cohort. Our dependent variable was N170 latency (average of left and right) and our clinically relevant covariate was age (continuously entered) because of demonstrated associations between age and N170 latency in our sample, and the absence of associations with other clinical variables. The Gaussian process regression was selected as the statistical model because it estimates distinct variance components and provides predictions for each participant that account for all sources of uncertainty. This normative model provides - at each age - a predicted mean latency and associated variances. Third, it is necessary to assess the accuracy of the normative model for predicting the response variable (e.g., mean-squared error, explained variance). The root mean squared error of the model was 24.4 ms with $22.3 \\%$ of the variance in N170 latency explained by age. For comparison, a linear fit of age on N170 latency has a RMSE of 25.4 ms and explains $17.0 \\%$ of the variance - an increase in variance explained by the normative model of $5.3 \\%$ over a linear fit. Finally, this model can be applied to quantifying the deviations of individual samples from a target cohort (e.g. clinical cohort) with respect to this reference model. Within the present context, we applied this normative model to data from the ASD group tested within LEAP. Specifically, for each participant in the target cohort we are able to compare the measured latency to the predicted mean latency and associated predicted variance from the normative"

First, the amount of change expected from a 12-week trial duration was simulated by fitting a linear model to the empirically observed change in Vineland Play and Leisure (PLT) subdomain v-scores from EU-AIMS LEAP, with baseline PLT v-score, age at time 1, and follow-up duration as predictors. Next, this fitted model was used to predict the PLT change scores expected from each subject over 12 weeks. Each subject's residual from the fitted model was then added to these predictions, as well as (for subjects simulated as randomly assigned to intervention) the Cohen's D multiplied by the residual population standard deviation (as estimated from the same model). Sample size per arm ranged from 25 to 250 subjects, simulated through sampling with replacement from either the enriched or non-enriched population (as defined above). Simulated Week 12 PLT v-scores were rounded to the nearest integer ( $v$-scale scores are integer-valued) and truncated to fall within the permissible v-score range $(0,24)$ before subtracting baseline PLT v-scale scores from these rounded and truncated Week 12 values to compute simulated change scores. Finally, for each simulated trial, these simulated 12-week change scores in the Vineland-II PLT were analysed using a linear model, with main effects of baseline score and intervention.\n\nThe statistical power is the probability of detecting an existent effect, in this case, the drug effect of Cohen's D of 0.45 (relative to the non-enriched population) in the hypothesized direction with a p-value <= 0.05 (two-sided).
