ChatGPT is a conversational chatbot that uses machine learning algorithms to enhance its replies based on user interactions and is a part of a broader effort to develop natural language processing that can assist people in their daily lives by understanding and responding to human language in a useful and engaging way. Thus far, many potential applications within healthcare have been described, despite its relatively recent release. This manuscript offers the pediatric surgical community a primer on this new technology and discusses some initial observations about its potential uses and pitfalls. Moreover, it introduces the perspectives of medical journals and surgical societies regarding the use of this artificial intelligence chatbot. As ChatGPT and other large language models continue to evolve, it is the responsibility of the pediatric surgery community to stay abreast of these changes and play an active role in safely incorporating them into our field for the benefit of our patients.\nLevel of Evidence: V.\n\n## (c) 2024 Elsevier Inc.
