    quote: "E. B\xE9al*, J. Cohen-Adad ${ }^{\\star \\mid A, C}$"
  affiliations:
  - value: NeuroPoly Lab, Institute of Biomedical Engineering, Polytechnique Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada
    reasoning: "Explicitly listed as the affiliation for E. B\xE9al, directly matched through an asterisk symbol."
    quote: '* NeuroPoly Lab, Institute of Biomedical Engineering, Polytechnique Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada'
  - value: Functional Neuroimaging Unit, CRiUGM, University of Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada
    reasoning: The letter A in the superscript (\(^{A}\)) next to J. Cohen-Adad corresponds to an affiliation with the Functional
